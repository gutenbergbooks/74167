<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>This book is an attempt to cover the whole field
of Greek Tragedy. My purpose throughout
has been twofold. Firstly, I have sought to
provide classical students with definite facts and with
help towards a personal appreciation of the plays they
read. My other intention has been to interest and in
some degree to satisfy those “general readers” who
have little or no knowledge of Greek. This second
function is to-day at least as important as the first.
Apart from the admirable progress shown in Europe
and the English-speaking world by many works of first-rate
Greek scholarship, in the forefront of which stand
Jebb’s monumental Sophocles, Verrall’s achievements
in dramatic criticism, and the unrivalled <i>Einleitung</i> of
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff,—the magnificent verse-translations
of Professor Gilbert Murray, springing from a
rare union of poetic genius with consummate scholarship,
have introduced in this country a new epoch of interest
in Greek drama among many thousands who are unacquainted
with the language. Even more momentous is
the fact that the feeling of educated people about drama
in general has been revolutionized and reanimated by the
creative genius of Ibsen, whose penetrating influence is
the chief cause of the present dramatic renaissance in
Great Britain.</p>

<p>Two important topics have been given more prominence
than is usual in books of this kind: dramatic
structure and the scansion of lyrics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span></p>

<p>It might have been supposed self-evident that the
former of these is a vital part, indeed the foundation, of
the subject, but it has suffered remarkable neglect or still
more remarkable superficiality of treatment: criticism of
the Greek tragedians has been vitiated time and again
by a tendency to ignore the very existence of dramatic
form. It is a strange reflection that the world of scholarship
waited till 1887 for the mere revelation of grave
difficulties in the plot of the <i>Agamemnon</i>. Examining
boards still prescribe “<i>Ajax</i> vv. 1-865,” on the naïve
assumption that they know better than Sophocles
where the play ought to end. Euripides has been
discussed with a perversity which one would scarcely
surpass if one applied to Anatole France the standards
appropriate to Clarendon. Throughout I have attempted
to follow the working of each playwright’s
mind, to realize what he meant his work to “feel like”.
This includes much besides structure, but the plot is
still, as in Aristotle’s day, “the soul of the drama”.</p>

<p>Chapter VI, on metre and rhythm, will, I hope,
be found useful. Greek lyrics are so difficult that
most students treat them as prose. I have done my
best to be accurate, clear, and simple, with the purpose
of enabling the sixth-form boy or undergraduate to
read his “chorus” with a sense of metrical and rhythmical
form. With regard to this chapter, even more
than the others, I shall welcome criticism and advice.</p>

<p>I have to thank my wife for much help, and my
friend Mr. Cyril Brett, M.A., who kindly offered to
make the Index.</p>

<h1>GREEK TRAGEDY</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="smaller">THE LITERARY HISTORY OF GREEK TRAGEDY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>All the types of dramatic poetry known in
Greece, tragic, satyric, and comic, originated
in the worship of Dionysus, the deity of wild
vegetation, fruits, and especially the vine. In his
honour, at the opening of spring, were performed
dithyrambs, hymns rendered by a chorus, who, dressed
like satyrs, the legendary followers of Dionysus, presented
by song and mimic dance stories from the
adventurous life of the god while on earth. It is from
these dithyrambs that tragedy and satyric drama both
sprang. The celebrated Arion, who raised the dithyramb
to a splendid art-form, did much<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> incidentally to aid
this development. His main achievement in this regard
is the insertion of spoken lines in the course of the
lyrical performance; it seems, further, that these verses
consisted of a dialogue between the chorus and the
chorus-leader, who mounted upon the sacrificial table.
Such interludes, no doubt, referred to incidents in the
sacred story, and the early name for an actor (ὑποκριτής,
“one who answers”) suggests that members of the
chorus asked their leader to explain features in the
ritual or the narrative.</p>

<p>At this point drama begins to diverge from the
dithyramb. With comedy we are not here concerned.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
The drama of the spring festival may be called “tragedy,”
but it was in a quite rudimentary state. Its lyrics, sung
by fifty “satyrs,” would altogether outshine in importance
the dialogue-interludes between chorus-leader
and individual singers; the theme, moreover, would be
always some event connected with Dionysus. Two
great changes were necessary before drama could enter
on free development: the use of impersonation in the
interludes and the admission of any subject at will of
the poet. The first was introduced by Thespis, who is
said to have “invented one actor”. The second was
perhaps later, but at least as early as Phrynichus we
find plays on subjects taken from other than Dionysiac
legends. It is said that the audience complained of this
innovation: “What has this to do with Dionysus?”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Another great development is attributed to Pratinas—the
invention of satyric drama. The more stately,
graver features and the frolicsome, often gross, elements
being separated, the way was clear for the free development
of tragedy and satyric into the forms we know.
But satyric work, though always showing playful characteristics
and a touch of obscenity, was never confounded
with comedy. Stately figures of legend or theology
regularly appeared in it—Odysseus in the <i>Cyclops</i>,
Apollo in the <i>Ichneutæ</i>—and it was a regular feature at
the presentations of tragedy; each tragic poet competed
with three tragedies followed by one satyric play. When
the latter form changed its tone slightly, as in the work of
the Alexandrian Pleiad,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> it approximated not to comedy
but to satire.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>The Dorians claimed the credit of having invented
both tragedy and comedy.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> There seems little doubt
that they provided the germ, though the glories of Greek
drama belong to Athens. Arion, whose contribution
has been described, if not himself a Dorian, worked
among Dorians at Corinth, which Pindar,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for example,
recognized as the birthplace of the dithyramb. Moreover
the lyrics of purely Attic tragedy show in their
language what is generally regarded as a slight Doric
colouring.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> sums up the rise of tragedy as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
“Tragedy ... was at first mere improvization ...
originating with the leaders of the dithyramb. It advanced
by slow degrees; each new element that showed
itself was in turn developed. Having passed through
many stages, it found its natural form, and there it
stopped. Æschylus first introduced a second actor; he
diminished the importance of the chorus, and assigned
the leading part to the dialogue. Sophocles raised the
number of actors to three, and added scene-painting.
It was not till late that the short plot was discarded for
one of greater compass, and the grotesque diction of the
earlier satyric form for the stately manner of tragedy.
The iambic measure then replaced the trochaic tetrameter,
which was originally employed when the poetry
was of the satyric order, and had greater affinities with
dancing.... The number of ‘episodes’ or acts was
also increased, and the other embellishments added, of
which tradition tells.”</p>

<p>We have but meagre knowledge of the drama before
Æschylus, whose vast achievement so overshadowed
his predecessors that their works were little read and
have in consequence practically vanished. Tragedy
was born at the moment when, as tradition relates,
<span class="smcap">Thespis</span> of Icaria in Attica introduced the actor. Arion,
as we saw, had already caused one of the chorus to
mount upon the sacrificial table or the step of the altar
and deliver a narrative, or converse with his fellow-choristers,
concerning Dionysus, using not lyrical metre,
but the trochaic tetrameter.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Thespis’ great advance
was to introduce a person who should actually present
the character to whom Arion’s chorister had merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
made allusion: the action, instead of being reported,
went on before the eyes of the audience. This change
clearly at once begets the possibility of drama, however
rudimentary. By retiring to the booth while the singers
perform their lyric, he can change his mask and costume
and reappear as another person; by learning and discussing
what has been said by his supposed predecessor,
he can exhibit the play of emotion or the construction
of a plan.</p>

<p>If this was done by Thespis, he was the founder of
European drama. His <i>floruit</i> may be assigned to the
year 535 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the date of the first dramatic competition
at Athens. But little is known of him. Aristotle in
his <i>Poetic</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> does not mention his name. Far later we
have the remarks of Horace, “Diogenes Laertius,”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and
Suidas. Horace tells<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that Thespis discovered tragic
poetry, and conveyed from place to place on waggons a
company of players who sang and acted his pieces, their
faces smeared with lees of wine: “Diogenes Laertius”
says that Thespis “discovered one actor”. Suidas
gives us the names of several plays, <i>Phorbas</i> or <i>The Trials</i>
(ἆθλα) <i>of Pelias</i>, <i>The Priests</i>, <i>The Youths</i>, <i>Pentheus</i>.
We possess four fragments alleged to belong to these,
but they are spurious. Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> moreover, affirms
that Tragedy was in the first place a matter of improvization.
The conclusion seems to be that Thespis
did not “write plays” in the modern sense of the phrase.
He was much more like those Elizabethan dramatists
who provided “the words” for their actors, and for
whom printing and publication were only thought of if
the play had achieved success upon the boards. He
stood midway between Æschylus and the unknown
actor-poets before Arion who improvized as they played.</p>

<p>The next name of importance is that of <span class="smcap">Chœrilus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></span>
the Athenian, who competed in tragedy for the first time
during the 64th Olympiad (524-1 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and continued
writing for the stage during forty years. He produced
one hundred and sixty plays, and obtained the first prize
thirteen times. Later generations regarded him as
especially excellent in the satyric drama<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> invented by his
younger contemporary Pratinas. To him were attributed
the invention of masks, as a substitute for the wine-lees
of Thespis, and more majestic costume. We know by
name only one of his works, the <i>Alope</i>, which is concerned
with the Attic hero Triptolemus. A fragment
or two reveal an unexpected preciosity of style; he
called stones and rivers “the bones and veins of the
earth”.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pratinas</span> of Phlius, in the north of the Peloponnese,
is said to have competed with Æschylus and Chœrilus
in the 70th Olympiad (500-497 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). His great achievement,
as we have said, was the invention of satyric
drama. Fifty plays are attributed to him, of which
thirty-two were satyric. Hardly any fragments of these
are extant, but we get some conception of the man from
a <i>hyporchema</i> in which he complains that music is encroaching
upon poetry: “let the flute follow the dancing
revel of the song—it is but an attendant”. With boundless
gusto and polysyllabic energy he consigns the flute
to flames and derision.</p>

<p>At length we reach a poet who seems to have been
really great, a dramatist whose works, even to a generation
which knew and reverenced Æschylus, seemed
unworthy to be let die—<span class="smcap">Phrynichus</span> of Athens, son of
Polyphradmon, whose first victory occurred 512-509 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
It is said that he was the first to bring female characters
upon the stage (always, however, played by men). The
following dramas are known by name: <i>Egyptians</i>;
<i>Alcestis</i>; <i>Antæus</i> or <i>The Libyans</i>; <i>The Daughters of
Danaus</i>; <i>The Capture of Miletus</i>; <i>Phœnician Women</i>
(<i>Phœnissæ</i>); <i>The Women of Pleuron</i>; <i>Tantalus</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
<i>Troilus</i>. The <i>Egyptians</i> seems to have dealt with the
same subject as the <i>Supplices</i> of Æschylus; so does the
<i>Danaides</i>; these two dramas may have formed part of
a trilogy. The <i>Alcestis</i> followed the same lines as the
Euripidean play; it is probable, indeed, that the apparition
of Death with a sword was borrowed by Euripides
from Phrynichus. The <i>Antæus</i> related the wrestling-match
between Heracles and his earth-born foe. The
manner in which Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> refers to the play shows
that the description of the wrestling-bout was still
celebrated after the lapse of a century. The <i>Pleuroniæ</i>
treated of Meleager and the fateful log which was
preserved, and then burnt in anger, by his mother
Althæa.</p>

<p>Two plays were specially important. The <i>Phœnissæ</i>
(produced in 476), celebrated the victory of Salamis, had
Themistocles himself for choregus, and won the prize;
its popularity never waned throughout the fifth century.
We are told that the prologue was spoken by an eunuch
while he placed the cushions for the Persian counsellors;
further—an important fact—that this person, at the beginning
of the play, announced the defeat of Xerxes.
The <i>Capture of Miletus</i>, less popular in later days—no
fragments at all are to be found—created even more
stir at the moment. Miletus had been captured by
Darius in 494 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Athens having failed to give effective
support to the Ionian revolt. While the distress
and shame excited by the fall of the proudest city in
Asiatic Greece were still strong in Athenian minds,
Phrynichus ventured to dramatize the disaster. Herodotus
tells how “the theatre burst into tears; they fined
him a thousand drachmæ for reminding them of their
own misfortunes, and gave command that no man
should ever use that play again”.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Few lost works are so sorely to be regretted as
those of Phrynichus. The collection of fragments
merely hints at a genius who commanded the affection
of an age which knew his great successors, a master
whose dignity was not utterly overborne by Æschylus,
and whose tenderness could still charm hearts which had
thrilled to the agonies of Medea and the romance of
Andromeda. The chief witness to his popularity is
Aristophanes, who paints for us a delightful picture<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of
the old men in the dark before the dawn, trudging by
lantern-light through the mud to the law-court, and
humming as they go the “charming old-world honeyed
ditties” from the <i>Phœnissæ</i>. In another play<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the
birds assert that it is from their song that “Phrynichus,
like his own bee, took his feast, food of the gods, the
fruit of song, and found unfailingly a song full sweet”.
One or two snatches survive from these lyrics, lines
from the <i>Phœnissæ</i> in the “greater Asclepiad” metre
which is the form of some of Sappho’s loveliest work,
and a verse<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> from the <i>Troilus</i> which Sophocles himself
quoted: “the light of love on rosy cheeks is beaming”.</p>

<p>It is clear that for most Athenians the spell of
Phrynichus lay in his songs; succeeding poets he impressed
almost equally as a playwright. It has already
been mentioned that Euripides seems to have borrowed
from the <i>Alcestis</i>. Æschylus, especially, was influenced
by his style, and in the <i>Persæ</i> followed the older poet
closely. Indeed the relation between the <i>Persæ</i> and
the <i>Phœnissæ</i> is puzzling, but ancient authority did not
hesitate to say that the later work was “modelled on”
the earlier.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is no question of a <i>réchauffé</i> to suit the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
taste of a later age, like the revisions of Shakespeare
by Davenant and Cibber, for the two tragedies are
separated at the utmost by only seven years; rather we
appear to have a problem like the connexion between
<i>Macbeth</i> and Middleton’s <i>Witch</i>. Perhaps the soundest
opinion is that the younger playwright wished to
demonstrate his own method of writing and his theory
of dramatic composition in the most striking way possible—by
choosing a famous drama of the more rudimentary
type and rewriting it as it ought to be written.
Two features in the <i>Phœnissæ</i> seem to lend support
to this view. Firstly, the prologue was delivered by a
slave who was preparing the seats of the Persian counsellors.
The <i>Persæ</i> expunges the man and his speech,
presenting us at once with the elders in deliberation.
Nothing is more characteristic of the architectonic power
in literature than the instinct to sweep away everything
but the minimum of mere machinery; at the first instant
we are in the midst of the plot. Secondly, the prologue
at once announced the disaster. Nothing was left
but the amplification of sorrow, a quasi-operatic presentation
by the Phœnician women who formed the
chorus. Here again the <i>Persæ</i> provides a most instructive
contrast.</p>

<p>From the fragments, from ancient testimony, and
from the recasting of the <i>Phœnissæ</i> which appeared
instinctive or necessary to Æschylus, we gain some
clear conception of Phrynichus. A lyrist of sweetness
and pellucid dignity, he has been compared<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> to his
contemporary Simonides; the graceful phrases in
which Aristophanes declared that Phrynichus drew
his inspiration from the birds recall to us the “native
wood-notes wild” of Shakespeare’s earlier achievement.
As a playwright in the strict sense he is, for
us, the first effective master, but still swayed by the
age of pure lyrists which was just reaching its culmination
and its close in Pindar—so greatly swayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
that the “episodes” were still little more than interruptions
of lyrics which gave but a static expression
to feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Æschylus</span>, the son of Euphorion, was born at
Eleusis in 525 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> At the age of twenty-five he
began to exhibit plays, but did not win the prize until
the year 485. The Persian invasions swept down upon
Athens when Æschylus had come to the maturity of
his powers. He served as a hoplite at Marathon<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and
his brother Cynegirus distinguished himself even on
that day of heroes by his desperate courage in attempting
to thwart the flight of the invaders. That the poet was
present at Salamis also may be regarded as certain
from the celebrated description in the <i>Persæ</i>. He
twice visited Sicily. On the first occasion, soon after
470 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, he accepted the invitation of Hiero, King
of Syracuse, and composed <i>The Women of Etna</i> to
celebrate the city which Hiero was founding on the
slope of that mountain. Various stories to explain
his retirement from Athens were circulated in antiquity.
Some relate that he was unnerved by a collapse of the
wooden benches during a performance of one of his
plays. Others said that he was defeated by Simonides
in a competition: the task was to write an epitaph on
those who fell at Marathon. According to others he
was chagrined by a dramatic defeat which he sustained
at the hands of the youthful Sophocles in 468. A
fourth story declared that he was accused of divulging
the Eleusinian Mysteries in one of his plays, and was
in danger of his life until he proved that he had himself
never been initiated. These stories are hard to accept.
Possibly he wrote something which offended against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Eleusinian rule, and was condemned to banishment
or possibly to death, which (as often occurred) he was
allowed to escape by voluntary exile. We cannot
suppose that he pleaded ignorance<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> seriously; a man
of his genuinely devout temperament, and a native
of Eleusis, must assuredly have been initiated. A
second visit to Sicily was taken after he had again
won the prize with the <i>Oresteia</i>. He never returned.
Story tells how he was sitting on the hillside near
the city of Gela when an eagle, flying with a tortoise
in its claws in quest of a stone whereon to crush it,
dropped its prey upon the bald head of the poet and
killed him. He left two sons, Euphorion and Bion,
who also pursued the tragic art—a tradition which
persisted in the family for generations.</p>

<p>Æschylus is too great a dramatist to receive detailed
treatment in the course of a general discussion;
a separate chapter must be allotted to this. At present
we shall consider only his position in the history of
tragedy.</p>

<p>The great technical change introduced by Æschylus
was that he “first introduced a second actor; he diminished
the importance of the chorus, and assigned the
leading part to the dialogue”.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The two last statements
are corollaries of the first, which describe a deeply important
advance. It has been said above that the
drama was founded by the man who “invented one
actor”; at the same time it is easy to realize how primitive
such drama must have been. The addition of
another actor did not double the resources of tragedy,
rather it increased them fifty-fold. To bring two opposed
or sympathetic characters face to face, to exhibit the
clash of principles by means of the clash of personalities,
this is a step forward into a new world, a change so great
that to call Æschylus the very inventor of tragedy is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
not unreasonable. This meagre equipment of two actors
was found sufficient by two of the fifth-century masters
for work<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of the highest value. The further remark of
Aristotle that Æschylus “diminished the importance
of the chorus” follows naturally from the vast increase in
the importance of the “episodes”.</p>

<p>Revolutionary as Æschylus was, he did not attain
at a bound to a characteristic dramatic form of his own
and then advance no farther. In his earliest extant
play, the <i>Supplices</i>, the alterations mentioned above are
certainly in operation, but their use is tentative. The
chorus is no doubt less dominant than it had been, but
it is the most important feature, even to a modern reader.
To an ancient spectator it must have appeared of even
greater moment. The number of singers was still fifty,
and the lyrics, accompanied by music and the dance of
this great company, occupy more than half of our present
text. We have left Phrynichus behind, but he is not out
of sight.</p>

<p>It is necessary at this point to give some account
of the life of <span class="smcap">Sophocles</span> and his position in dramatic
history, though a detailed discussion of his extant
work must be reserved for a separate chapter. He
was born about 496 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the son of a well-to-do citizen
named Sophillus, and received, in addition to the usual
education, more advanced training in music from the
celebrated Lampros. The youth’s physical beauty was
remarkable, and at the age of sixteen he was chosen
to lead the choir of boys who performed the pæan
celebrating the victory of Salamis. Nothing more is
known of his life till the year 468, when he produced
his first tragedy. One of his fellow-competitors was
Æschylus, and we are told<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> that feeling ran so high
that the Archon, instead of choosing the judges by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
lot as usual, entrusted the decision to the board of
generals; they awarded the victory to the youthful
Sophocles. For sixty years he produced a steady
stream of dramatic work with continuous success. He
at first performed in his own plays—his skill in the
<i>Nausicaa</i> gained great applause—but was compelled
to give this up owing to the failure of his voice. The
number of his plays was well over a hundred, performed
in groups of four, and he won eighteen victories at the
City Dionysia; even when he failed of the first prize,
he was never lower than the second place.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> His genius
seems even to have increased with advancing age; he
was about ninety when he wrote the <i>Œdipus Coloneus</i>.
Sophocles took a satisfactory if not prominent part
in public life,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> being twice elected general, once with
Pericles and later with Nicias. He served also as Hellenotamias—a
member, that is, of the Treasury Board
which administered the funds of the Delian Confederacy.
It is an interesting comment on the early part of the
<i>Œdipus Coloneus</i> that the poet acted as priest of two
heroes, Asclepius and Alcon. He had several sons,
the most celebrated of whom was Iophon, himself a
tragedian of repute. A famous story relates that
Iophon, being jealous of his illegitimate brother, brought
a suit to prove his father’s insanity, with the intent
to become administrator of his estate. The aged poet’s
defence consisted in a recitation of the <i>Œdipus Coloneus</i>
which he had just completed, and the jury most naturally
dismissed Iophon’s petition. He died late in
406 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, fully ninety years old, a few months later
than Euripides, and not long before the disaster of
Ægospotami. The Athenian people mourned him as
a hero under the name of Dexion, “The Entertainer,”
or “Host,” and brought yearly sacrifice to his shrine.</p>

<p>The personality of Sophocles stands out more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
definitely before the modern eye than that of perhaps any
other fifth-century Greek. His social talent made him
a noted figure whose good sayings were repeated, and of
whom the gossips as well as the critics loved to circulate
illustrative stories. He seemed the embodiment of all
that man can ask. Genius, good health, industry, long
life, personal beauty, affluence, popularity, and the sense
of power—all were his, and enjoyed in that very epoch
which, beyond all others, seems to have combined
stimulus with satisfaction. Salamis was fought and
won just as he had left childhood behind. His adolescence
and maturity coincided with the rise and establishment
of the Athenian Empire; he listened to
Pericles, saw the Parthenon and Propylæa rise upon
the Acropolis, associated with Æschylus, Euripides,
Aristophanes, and Thucydides, watched the work of
Phidias and Polygnotus grow to life under their fingers.
Though he carried into the years of Nestor the genius
of Shakespeare, he was yet so blessed that he died
before the fall of Athens. Phrynichus, the comic poet,
wrote: “Blessed was Sophocles, who passed so many
years before his death, a happy man and brilliant, who
wrote many beautiful tragedies and made a fair end of
a life which knew no misfortune”.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Sophocles’ own
words<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> come as a significant comment:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">μὴ φῦναι τὸν ἅπαντα νικᾷ λόγον.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τὸ δ’, ἐπεὶ φανῇ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">βῆναι κεῖθεν ὅθενπερ ἥκει,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">πολὺ δεύτερον ὡς τάχιστα.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Best of all fates—when a man weighs everything—is
not to be born, and second-best beyond doubt is, once
born, to depart with all speed to that place whence we
came.”</p>

<p>Of his social charm there are many evidences. He
gathered round him a kind of literary club or <i>salon</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Some hint of the talk in this circle may be gathered from
the fragment of Ion’s <i>Memoirs</i> which tells how when the
poet came to Chios he engaged in critical battle with the
local schoolmaster concerning poetical adjectives, and
quoted with approbation Phrynichus’ line λάμπει δ’ ἐπὶ
πορφυρέαις παρῇσι φῶς ἔρωτος. He was a friend of
Herodotus, from whom he quotes more than once, and
to whom he addressed certain elegiac verses. With
regard to his own art, we possess two remarks of deep
interest. The first is reported by Aristotle:<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> “I depict
men as they ought to be, Euripides depicts them as they
are”. It is excellent Attic for “he is a realist, I am
an idealist”. Nevertheless, he esteemed his rival;
when he led forth his chorus for the first time after the
news of Euripides’ death in Macedonia had reached
Athens, he and his singers wore the dress of mourning.
The second remark is a brief account<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of his own development:
“My dramatic wild oats were imitation of
Æschylus’ pomp; then I evolved my own harsh mannerism;
finally I embraced that style which is best, as
most adapted to the portrayal of human nature”. All
that we now possess would seem to belong to his third
period, though certain characteristics of the <i>Antigone</i>
may put us in mind of the second.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Apart altogether from his glorious achievement in
actual composition, Sophocles is highly important as an
innovator in technique. The changes which he introduced
are: (i) the number of actors was raised from two
to three;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> (ii) scene-painting was invented<a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; (iii) the
plays of a tetralogy were, sometimes at any rate, no
longer part of a great whole, but quite distinct in subject;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
(iv) it is said<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that he raised the number of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
chorus from twelve to fifteen, was the first tragedian to
use Phrygian music and to give his actors the bent staff
and white shoe which they sometimes used.</p>

<p>The points named under (iv) are of small importance
save the change in the number of <i>choreutæ</i>, but that is a
detail which can scarcely be accepted, Æschylus during
part of his career employed fifty <i>choreutæ</i>, and it is
extremely improbable that the number sank as low as
twelve, only to rise slightly again at once. The invention
of scene-painting is clearly momentous; it became
easy to fix the action at any spot desired, and a change
of scene also became possible. Æschylus, of course, in
his later years made use of this development. The other
two points are vital.</p>

<p>Though the stage gained immensely by the introduction
of a third actor, little perhaps need be said on
the point. An examination of the early Æschylean
plays, and even of the <i>Choephorœ</i> or <i>Agamemnon</i>, side by
side with the <i>Philoctetes</i> or <i>Œdipus Coloneus</i>, will make
the facts abundantly clear. In the crisis of <i>Œdipus
Tyrannus</i> (for example) the presence of Jocasta,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> while
her husband hears the tidings brought by the Corinthian,
does not merely add to the poignancy of the scene; it
may almost be said to create it.</p>

<p>The last change, that of breaking up the tetralogy
into four disconnected tragedies, is equally fundamental.
The older poet was a man of simple ideas and gigantic
grasp. His conceptions demanded the vast scope of a
trilogy, and perhaps the most astonishing feature of his
work is the fact that, while each drama is a splendid and
self-intelligible whole, it gains its full import only from
the significance of the complete organism. Sophocles
realized that he possessed a narrower, if more subtle,
genius, and moulded his technique to suit his powers.
Each of his works, however spacious and statuesque it
may seem beside <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Lear</i>, or even <i>Hippolytus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
shows, as compared with Æschylus, a closeness of texture
in characterization and a delicate stippling of language,
which mark nothing less than a revolution.</p>

<p>Tradition tells that <span class="smcap">Euripides</span> was born at Salamis
on the very day of the great victory (480 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>); the
Parian marble puts the date five years earlier. He was
thus a dozen or more years younger than Sophocles.
His father’s name was Mnesarchus; his mother Clito is
ridiculed by Aristophanes as a petty green-grocer, but
all other evidence suggests that they were well-to-do;
Euripides was able to devote himself to drama, from which
little financial reward could be expected, and to collect
a library—a remarkable possession for those days. He
lived almost entirely for his art, though he must, like other
citizens, have seen military service. His public activities
seem to have included nothing more extraordinary than
a single “embassy” to Syracuse. Unlike Sophocles, he
cared little for society save that of a few intimates, and
wrote much in a cave on Salamis which he had fitted up
as a study. The great philosopher Anaxagoras was his
friend and teacher; several passages<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> in the extant plays
point plainly to his influence. It was in Euripides’
house that Protagoras read for the first time his treatise
on the gods which brought about the sophist’s expulsion
from Athens. Socrates himself is traditionally regarded
as the poet’s friend. Aulus Gellius<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> says that he began
to write tragedy at the age of eighteen; but it was
not till 455 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (when he was perhaps thirty) that he
“obtained a chorus”—that is, had his work accepted for
performance. One of these pieces was the <i>Peliades</i>; he
obtained only the third place. By the end of his life he
had written nearly a hundred dramas, including satyric
works, but obtained the first prize only four times: his
fifth victory was won by the tetralogy which included
the <i>Bacchæ</i>, performed after his death. His influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
was far out of proportion to these scanty rewards.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> On
any given occasion he might be defeated by some talented
mediocrity who hit the taste of the moment. When he
offered the <i>Medea</i> itself he was overcome, not only by
Sophocles, but by Euphorion; yet his vast powers were
recognized by all Athens. Euripides was married—twice
it is said—and had three sons. Late in his life he
accepted an invitation from Archelaus, King of Macedonia;
after living there a short time in high favour and
writing his latest plays, he died in 406 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He was
buried in Macedonia and a cenotaph was erected to his
memory in Attica.</p>

<p>Further light both on the career and works of
Euripides has recently been provided by an interesting
discovery. In 1912 Dr. Arthur S. Hunt published<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
extensive fragments of a life of the poet by Satyrus,
from portions of a papyrus-roll found at Oxyrhynchus
in Egypt by Dr. Grenfell and Dr. Hunt. Satyrus
lived in the third century before Christ: our MS.
itself is dated by its discoverers “from the middle or
latter part of the second century” after Christ. The
most striking points are (i) Satyrus quotes the fragment
of the <i>Pirithous</i> dealt with below,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> attributing it, as was
often done, to Euripides, and saying that the poet “has
accurately embraced the whole cosmogony of Anaxagoras
in three periods”;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> (ii) there are new fragments,
on the vain pursuit of wealth; (iii) the poet was prosecuted
for impiety by the statesman Cleon; (iv) we read
that Euripides wrote the proem for the <i>Persæ</i> composed
by his friend the musician Timotheus; (v)
Satyrus, in discussing <i>peripeteia</i>, mentions “ravishings,
supposititious infants, and recognitions by means of rings
and necklaces—for these, as you know, are the back-bone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of the New Comedy, and were perfected by
Euripides”.</p>

<p>A discussion of Euripides’ surviving work will be
found in a separate chapter. Our business here is to
indicate his position in the development of technique.
Though he is for ever handling his material and the
resources of the stage in an original and experimental
manner, the definite changes which he introduced are
few. That many of his dramas are not tragedies at all
but tragicomedies, is a development of the first importance.
Another fact of this kind is his musical innovations.
The lyrics of his plays tend to become less
important as literature and to subserve the music, in
which he introduced fashions not employed before, such
as the “mixed Lydian”; it is impossible to criticize
some of his later odes without knowledge, which we do
not possess, of the music which he composed for them
and the manner in which he caused them to be rendered.
Hence the loose syntax, the polysyllabic vagueness of
expression, and the repeated words—features which
irritated Aristophanes and many later students.</p>

<p>Another novelty is his use of the prologue. Since
this is properly nothing but “that part of the play which
precedes the first song of the whole chorus,”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> prologues
are of course found in Æschylus and Sophocles. The
peculiarity of the Euripidean prologue is that it tends to
be non-dramatic, a narrative enabling the spectator to
understand at what point in a legend the action is to
begin. It is from Euripides’ use of the prologue that
the modern meaning of the word is derived.</p>

<p>Aristophanes in his <i>Frogs</i> makes a famous attack upon
most<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> sides of Euripides’ art as contrasted with that of
Æschylus. But it is often forgotten that, damned utterly
as the younger tragedian is, Æschylus by no means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
escapes criticism. Many of the censures put into
Euripides’ mouth are just and important; it seems likely
that Aristophanes is practically quoting his victim’s
conversation; the remark<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> about Æschylus that “he
was obscure in his prologues,” is no mere rubbish attributed
to a dullard. That Euripides did criticize his
elder is a fact. The <i>Supplices</i><a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> contains a severe remark
on the catalogue of chieftains in the <i>Septem</i>; the elaborate
sarcasm directed in the <i>Electra</i><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> against the Recognition-scene
of the <i>Choephorœ</i> is even more startling.
Besides this, Aristophanes seems to quote remarks of
Euripides on himself and his work: “When I first took
over the art from you, I found it swollen with braggadocio
and tiresome words; so the first thing I did was to train
down its fat and reduce its weight”.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> His comment on
dialogue is no less pertinent: “With you Niobe and
Achilles never said a word, but I left no personage idle;
women, slaves, and hags all spoke”.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Finally, there
is the perfect description of his own realism<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>: οἰκεῖα
πράγματ’ εἰσάγων, οἷς χρώμεθ’, οἷς σύνεσμεν, “I introduced
life as we live it, the things of our everyday experience”.
Such sentences as these reflect unmistakably the
conversation of a playwright who was jealous for the
dignity and the progress of his art.</p>

<p>Though during his own time Euripides was hardly
equal in repute to his two companions, scarcely had
his Macedonian grave closed over him than his popularity
began to overshadow theirs. Æschylus became
a dim antique giant; Sophocles, though always admired,
was too definitely Attic and Periclean to retain
all his prestige in the Hellenistic world. It was the
more cosmopolitan poet who won posthumous applause
from one end of the civilized earth to the other. From
400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to the downfall of the ancient world he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
unquestionably better known and admired than any
other dramatist. This is shown by the much larger
collection of his work which has survived, by the
imitation of later playwrights, and by innumerable
passages of citation, praise, and comment in writers
of every kind. He shared with Homer, Vergil, and
Horace the equivocal distinction of becoming a schoolbook
even in ancient times. Nine of our nineteen
plays were selected for this purpose: <i>Alcestis</i>, <i>Andromache</i>,
<i>Hecuba</i>, <i>Hippolytus</i>, <i>Medea</i>, <i>Orestes</i>, <i>Phœnissæ</i>,
<i>Rhesus</i>, and <i>Troades</i>. It is not easy to see what
principle of selection prompted the educationists of
the day: <i>Andromache</i> and <i>Hippolytus</i> do not strike
a modern reader as specially “suitable”. Owing
to their use in schools they were annotated; these
<i>scholia</i> are still extant and are often of great value.
In the Byzantine age the number was reduced to three:
<i>Hecuba</i>, <i>Orestes</i>, <i>Phœnissæ</i>.</p>

<p>Among the numerous lesser tragedians of the fifth
century five hold a distinguished place: Neophron of
Sicyon, Aristarchus of Tegea, Ion of Chios, Achæus of
Eretria, Agathon of Athens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neophron</span> is an enigmatic figure. It would seem
that he was an important forerunner of Euripides. Not
only do we learn that he wrote one hundred and twenty
tragedies and that he was the first to bring upon the
stage “pædagogi” and the examination of slaves under
torture; it is said also that his <i>Medea</i> was the original
of Euripides’ tragedy so-named.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> “Pædagogi” or
elderly male attendants of children are familiar in
Euripides, and the “questioning” of slaves is shown
(though not to the audience) in the <i>Ion</i>.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> As for the
third point, we have three fragments which clearly recall
the extant play—a few lines in which Ægeus requests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Medea to explain the oracle, a few more in which she
tells Jason how he shall die, and the celebrated passage
which reads like a shorter version of her great soliloquy
when deciding to slay her children. There is the same
anguish, the same vacillation, the same address to her
“passion” (θυμός). Such a writer is plainly epoch-making:
he adds a new feature to tragedy in the life-time of
Sophocles. The realism of everyday life and the pangs
of conscience battling with temptation—these we are
wont to call Euripidean. But some have denied the
very existence of Neophron as a dramatist: the fragments
are fourth-century forgeries, or Euripides brought
out a first edition<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of his play under Neophron’s name.
Against these views is the great authority of Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
who, however, may have been deceived by the name
“Neophron” in official records. An argument natural
to modern students, that a poet of Euripides’ calibre
would not have borrowed and worked up another’s play,
is of doubtful strength. Æschylus, as we have seen,
probably acted so towards Phrynichus. The best view
is probably that of antiquity. We may note that Sicyon
is close to Corinth, and that a legend domestic to the
latter city might naturally find its first treatment in a
playwright of Sicyon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristarchus</span> of Tegea, whose <i>début</i> is to be dated
about 453 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, is said by Suidas to have lived for over
a hundred years, to have written seventy tragedies,
two of which won the first prize, and one of which was
called <i>Asclepius</i> (a thank-offering for the poet’s recovery
from an illness), and to have “initiated the
present length of plays”.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This latter point sounds
important, but it is difficult to understand precisely what
Suidas means. For though the average Sophoclean
or Euripidean tragedy is longer than the Æschylean,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Aristarchus began work later than Sophocles and no
earlier than Euripides. It has been thought that
Suidas refers to the length of dramas in post-Euripidean
times, but of these we have perhaps no examples.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Aristarchus’ reputation was slight but enduring. Ennius
two and a half centuries later translated his <i>Achilles</i> into
Latin; the same work is quoted in the prologue of Plautus’
<i>Pœnulus</i>. A phrase<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> from another play became
proverbial.</p>

<p>A more distinguished but probably less important
writer was <span class="smcap">Ion</span> of Chios, son of Orthomenes, who lived
between 484 and 421 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> A highly accomplished
man of ample means, he travelled rather widely. In
Athens he must have spent considerable time, for
he was intimate with Cimon and his circle, and produced
plays the number of which is by one authority put at
forty. Besides tragedy and satyric drama, he wrote
comedies, dithyrambs, hymns, pæans, elegies, epigrams,
and scolia. He was, moreover, distinguished in prose
writing: we hear of a book on the <i>Founding of Chios</i>,
of a philosophic work, and of certain memoirs.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This
latter work must be a real loss to us, if we may judge
from its fragments. In the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> no one
but a facile Ionian would have thought it worth while
to record mere gossip even about the great; for us
there is great charm in an anecdote like that of the
literary discussion between Sophocles and the schoolmaster,
or the exclamation of Æschylus at the Isthmian
Games.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Ion would seem to have been less a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
poet than a delightful <i>belletrist</i>; the quality is well
shown in his remark<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that life, like a tragic tetralogy,
should have a satyric element. One year he obtained
a sensational success by winning the first prize both
for tragedy and for a dithyramb; to commemorate
this he presented to each Athenian citizen a cask of
Chian wine. He died before 421, the date of Aristophanes’
<i>Peace</i>,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> wherein he is spoken of as transformed
into a star, in allusion to a charming lyric passage of
his:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀώϊον ἀεροφοίταν</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀστέρα μείναμεν ἀελίου λευκοπτέρυγα πρόδρομον.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“We awaited the star that wanders through the dawn-lit
sky, pale-winged courier of the sun.”</p>

<p>His tragedies,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> though they do not appear to have
had much effect on the progress of technique or on
public opinion, were popular. Aristophanes, for instance,
nearly twenty years after his death, quotes a phrase from
his <i>Sentinels</i><a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> as proverbial, and centuries later the
author of the treatise <i>On the Sublime</i><a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> wrote his celebrated
verdict: “In lyric poetry would you prefer to be
Bacchylides rather than Pindar? And in tragedy to be
Ion of Chios rather than—Sophocles? It is true that
Bacchylides and Ion are faultless and entirely elegant
writers of the polished school, while Pindar and Sophocles,
although at times they burn everything before them as
it were in their swift career, are often extinguished unaccountably
and fail most lamentably. But would anyone
in his senses regard all the compositions of Ion put
together as an equivalent for the single play of the
Œdipus?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Achæus</span> of Eretria was born in 484 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and exhibited
his first play at Athens in 447. He won only one first
prize though we hear that he composed over forty plays,
nearly half of which are known by name. That he
was second only to Æschylus in satyric drama was the
opinion held by that delightful philosopher Menedemus<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
the minor Socratic, the seat of whose school was Eretria
itself, Achæus’ birthplace.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the apparent disproportion
of satyric plays written by Achæus is to be accounted
for by his having written them for other poets.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He is
once copied by Euripides and parodied twice by Aristophanes.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
Athenæus makes an interesting comment
on his style: “Achæus of Eretria, though an elegant
poet in the structure of his plots, occasionally blackens
his phrasing and produces many cryptic expressions”.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The instance which he gives is significant:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">λιθάργυρος δ’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ὄλπη παρηωρεῖτο χρίσματος πλέα</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τὸν Σπαρτιάτην γραπτὸν ἐν διπλῷ ξύλῳ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">κύρβιν,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“the cruse of alloyed silver, filled with ointment, swung
beside the Spartan tablet, double wood inscribed”.
That is, “he carried an oil-flask and a Spartan general’s
bâton”. Aiming at dignified originality of diction
Achæus has merely fallen into queerness. On the
other side, when he seeks vigorous realism he becomes
quaintly prosaic. In the <i>Philoctetes</i>, for instance, Agamemnon
utters the war-cry ἐλελελεῦ in the middle of an
iambic line.</p>

<p>A far more noteworthy dramatist was <span class="smcap">Agathon</span> the
Athenian, who seems to have impressed his contemporaries,
and even the exacting Aristotle, as coming next in
merit to the three masters. Born about 446 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
won his first victory in 416 and retired to the Court
of the Macedonian prince Archelaus some time before
the death of Euripides (406). From contemporary
evidence we gather that he was popular as a writer and
as a social figure, handsome, and given to voluptuous
living.</p>

<p>Three striking innovations are credited to him:—</p>

<p>(i) He produced at least one play of which both
the plot and the characters were invented by himself.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
The name of this “attractive” drama is uncertain: it
may have been <i>The Flower</i> (<i>Anthos</i>) or <i>Antheus</i>.
Agathon, here as elsewhere, shows himself a follower
of Euripides. The master had employed recognized
myths as a framework for a thoroughly “modern”
treatment of ordinary human interests; his disciple
finally throws aside the convention of antiquity.</p>

<p>(ii) Another post-Euripidean feature is the use of
musical interludes. Aristotle tells us: “As for the later
poets, their choral songs pertain as little to the subject of
the piece as to that of any other tragedy. They are
therefore sung as mere interludes—a practice first begun
by Agathon.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Our poet then is once more found completing
a process which his friend had carried far.
Sophocles had diminished the length and dramatic importance
of the lyrics, but with him they were still
entirely relevant. Euripides shows a strong tendency to
write his odes as separable songs, but complete irrelevance
is hardly found. Plays such as Agathon’s could obviously
be performed, if necessary, without the trouble and expense
of a chorus, which in process of time altogether
disappeared. His interludes served, it seems, more as
divisions between “acts” than as an integral part of the
play. In this connexion should be mentioned his innovation
in the accompaniment—the use of “chromatic”
or coloured style.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> His florid music is laughed at by
Aristophanes as “ants’ bye-paths”.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>(iii) Occasionally he took a great extent of legend
as the topic of a single drama, and it seems likely<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> that
he composed a <i>Fall of Troy</i>, taking the whole epic
subject instead of an episode. Agathon is trying yet
another experiment—it was necessary for a writer of his
powers to vary in some way from Euripides, but this
attempt was unsatisfactory.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Thesmophoriazusæ</i> Aristophanes pays
Agathon the honour of elaborate parody. Euripides
comes to beg his friend to plead for him before an
assembly of Athenian women, and the scene in which
Agathon amid much pomp explains the principles of his
art, contains definite and valuable criticism under the
usual guise of burlesque; that Aristophanes valued him
is shown by the affectionate pun on his name which he
introduces into the <i>Frogs</i> (v. 84):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀγαθὸς ποιητὴς καὶ ποθεινὸς τοῖς φίλοις,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“a good poet, sorely missed by his friends”. Plato
lays the scene of his <i>Symposium</i> in the house of Agathon,
who is celebrating his first tragic victory; the poet is
depicted as a charming host, and, when the conversation
turns to a series of panegyrics upon the god of Love,
offers a contribution to which we shall return.</p>

<p>From these sources we learn as usual little about the
poet’s dramatic skill, much as to his literary style. But
under the first head falls a vital remark of Aristotle:
“in his reversals of the action (<i>i.e.</i> the <i>peripeteia</i>), however,
he shows a marvellous skill in the effort to hit the
popular taste—to produce a tragic effect that satisfies
the moral sense. This effect is produced when the clever
rogue, like Sisyphus, is outwitted, or the brave villain
defeated. Such an event is, moreover, probable in
Agathon’s sense of the word: ‘it is probable,’ he says,
‘that many things should happen contrary to probability’.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Agathon belongs to the class of playwrights
who win popularity by bringing down to the customary
theatrical level the methods and ideas of a genius who is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
himself too undiluted and strange for his contemporaries.
Agathon’s relation to Euripides resembles that of (let us
say) Mr. St. John Hankin, in his later work, to Ibsen.
Of his literary style much the same may be said. He
loves to moralize on chance and probability and the
queer twists of human nature, with Euripides’ knack of
neatness but without his insight. Such things as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">μόνου γὰρ αὐτοῦ καὶ θεὸς στερίσκεται,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀγένητα ποιεῖν ἅσσ’ ἂν ᾖ πεπραγμένα</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“this alone is beyond the power even of God, to make
undone that which has been done,” and even the celebrated
τέχνη τύχην ἔστερξε καὶ τύχη τέχνην, “skill loves
luck, and luck skill,” give the measure of his power over
epigram. His easy way of expressing simple ideas with
admirable neatness may remind us of a much greater
dramatist—Terence, or, in later times, of Marivaux.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Plato tells us that he was a pupil both of Prodicus<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
and of Gorgias,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> the renowned sophists, and we may
trace their teaching in the fragments and in the remarkable
speech which the greatest stylist of all time puts
into his mouth in the <i>Symposium</i>—the rhymes, antitheses,
quibbles, and verbal trickiness of argument. The parody,
both brilliant and careful, which Aristophanes presents
at the opening of his <i>Thesmophoriazusæ</i> is directed
chiefly perhaps against his music, whereof we have no
trace. The blunt auditor, Mnesilochus, describes it as
lascivious.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The words set to it read like a feeble
copy of Euripides—fluent, copious, nerveless, in spite
of the “lathe,” the “glue,” the “melting-pot,” and the
“moulds”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> over which his satirist makes merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Agathon, then, marks unmistakably the beginning
of decadence. The three masters had exhausted the
possibilities of the art open to that age. A new impulse
from without or the social emancipation of women might
have opened new paths of achievement. But no great
external influence was to come till Alexander, and then
the result for Greece itself was loss of independence and
vigour. And the little that could be done with women
still in the harem or the slave-market was left to be
performed by Menander and his fellow-comedians.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Agathon made a valiant effort to carry tragedy into new
channels, but lacked the genius to leave more than clever
experiments.</p>

<p>On a lower plane of achievement stands <span class="smcap">Critias</span>, the
famous leader of the “Thirty Tyrants”. Two tragedies
from his pen are known to us, <i>Pirithous</i><a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and <i>Sisyphus</i>,
both at one time attributed to Euripides; but he is too
doctrinaire, too deficient in brilliant idiomatic ease, for
such a mistake to endure. The <i>Pirithous</i> deals with
Heracles’ descent into Hades to rescue Theseus and to
demand of Pluto Persephone’s hand for Pirithous. Of
this astounding story we find little trace in the fragments,
which are mostly quasi-philosophical dicta. For instance:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A temper sound more stable is than law;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The one no politician’s eloquence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can warp, but law by tricks of cunning words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full often is corrupted and unhinged.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In strong contrast to these prosaic lines is Critias’
superb apostrophe to the Creator, which may be paraphrased
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>From all time, O Lord, is thy being; neither is there any that saith,
This is my son.</p>

<p>All that is created, lo, thou hast woven the firmament about it; the
heavens revolve, and all that is therein spinneth like a wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>Thou hast girded thyself with light; the gloom of dusk is about thee,
even as a garment of netted fire.</p>

<p>Stars without number dance around thee; they cease not, they move
in a measure through thy high places.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">From the same hymn probably comes the majestic passage
which tells of “unwearied Time that in full flood
ever begets himself, and the Great Bear and the
Less....”</p>

<p>In apparent contrast to this tone is the remarkable
passage, of forty-two lines, from the <i>Sisyphus</i>. It is a
purely rationalistic account of religion. First human
life was utterly brutish: there were no rewards for
righteousness, no punishment of evil-doers. Then law
was set up, that justice might be sovereign; but this
device only added furtiveness to sin. Finally, “some
man of shrewdness and wisdom ... introduced religion”
(or “the conception of God,” τὸ θεῖον), so that
even in secret the wicked might be restrained by fear.
The contradiction between these two plays is illusory:
Critias combines with disbelief in the personal Greek
gods belief in an impersonal First Cause. It is too
often forgotten that among the “Thirty Tyrants” were
men of strong religious principles. The democratic
writers of Athens loved to depict them as mercenary
butchers, but it is plain from the casual testimony of
Lysias<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> that they looked upon themselves as moral
reformers. “They <i>said</i> that it was their business to
purge the city of wicked men, and turn the rest of the
citizens to righteousness and self-restraint.” Such passages
read like quotations from men who would inaugurate
a “rule of the saints,” and if their severities
surpassed those of the English Puritans, they were themselves
outdone by the cruelty which sternly moral
leaders of the French Revolution not only condoned but
initiated. Critias was the Athenian Robespierre. But
the one revolution was the reverse of the other. The
<i>régime</i> of the Thirty was a last violent effort of the
Athenian oligarchs to stem the tide of ochlocracy, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
induce some self-discipline into the freedom of Athens.
They failed, and Critias was justified on the field of
Chæronea.</p>

<p>The most successful tragic playwright of the fourth
century was <span class="smcap">Astydamas</span>, whose history furnishes good
evidence that after the disappearance of Euripides
and Sophocles the Greek genius was incapable of
carrying tragedy into new developments. While prose
could boast such names as Plato and Demosthenes,
the tragic art found no greater exponent than this
Astydamas, of whose numerous plays nothing is left
save nine odd lines. There were, moreover, two
Astydamantes, father and son, whose works (scarcely
known save by name) it is difficult to distinguish. But
it seems that it was the son whose popularity was so
great as to win him fifteen first prizes and an honour
before unknown. His <i>Parthenopæus</i> won such applause
in 340 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> that the Athenians set up a brazen statue
of the playwright in the theatre; it was not till ten
years later that the orator Lycurgus persuaded them
to accord a like honour to the three Masters. We
learn from Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> that Astydamas altered the story
of Alcmæon, causing him to slay his mother in ignorance;
and Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> alludes to his <i>Hector</i> as one
of the greatest plays. He was nothing more than
a capable writer who caught the taste of his time, and
probably owed much of his popularity to the excellence
of his actors.</p>

<p>Only one fact is known about <span class="smcap">Polyidus</span> “the
sophist,” but that is sufficiently impressive. Aristotle
twice<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> takes the Recognition-scene in his <i>Iphigenia</i>
as an example, and in the second instance actually compares
the work of Polyidus with one of Euripides’
most wonderful successes—the Recognition-scene in
the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i>. It appears that as Orestes
was led away to slaughter he exclaimed: “Ah! So I
was fated, like my sister, to be sacrificed.” This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
catches the attention of Iphigenia and saves his life.
Polyidus here undoubtedly executed a brilliant <i>coup
de théâtre</i>.</p>

<p>During the fourth century many tragedians wrote
not for public performance but for readers. Of these
ἀναγνωστικοί<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the most celebrated was <span class="smcap">Chæremon</span>, of
whom sufficient fragments and notices survive to give a
distinct literary portrait. Comic poets ridiculed his preciosity:
he called water “river’s body,” ivy “the year’s
child,” and loved word-play: πρὶν γὰρ φρονεῖν εὖ
καταφρονεῖν ἐπίστασαι.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> But though a sophisticated attention
to style led him into such frigid mannerisms, he
can express ideas with a brief Euripidean cogency: perhaps
nothing outside the work of the great masters was
more often quoted in antiquity than his dictum “Human
life is luck, not discretion”—τύχη τὰ θνητῶν πράγματ’,
οὐκ εὐβουλία.</p>

<p>The only technical peculiarity attributed to him
is the play <i>Centaur</i>, if play it was. Athenæus calls
it a “drama in many metres,”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> while Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> uses
the word “rhapsody,” implying epic quality. It may
be that the epic or narrative manner was used side
by side with the dramatic in the manner of Bunyan.
Here is another proof that by the time of Euripides
tragedy had really attained its full development. Attempts
at new departures in technique are all abortive
after his day.</p>

<p>A delightful point which emerges again and again
is Chæremon’s passion for flowers. From <i>Thyestes</i>
come two phrases—“the sheen of roses mingled with
silver lilies,” and “strewing around the children of
flowering spring”—which indicate, as do many others,
Chæremon’s love of colour and sensuous loveliness. It
was his desire to express all the details of what pleased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
his eye that led him into preciosity—a laboured embroidery
which recalls Keats’ less happy efforts. But
he can go beyond mere mannerism. A splendid fragment
of his <i>Œneus</i> shows Chæremon at his best:
it describes the half-nude beauty of girls sleeping in
the moonlight. One can hardly believe that Chæremon
belonged to the fourth century and was studied by
Aristotle. In this passage, despite its voluptuous dilettantism,
there is a sense of physical beauty, above all of
colour and sensuous detail, which was unknown since
Pindar, and is not to be found again, even in Theocritus,
till we come to the Greek novelists. In one
marvellous sentence, too, he passes beyond mere prettiness
to poetry, expressing with perfect mastery the truth
that the sight of beauty is the surest incentive to chastity:
κἀξεπεσφραγίζετο ὥρας γελώσης χωρὶς ἐλπίδων
ἔρως:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">Love, his passion quelled by awe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Printed his smiling soul on all he saw.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is the idea which Meredith has voiced so magically
in <i>Love in the Valley</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love that so desires would fain keep her changeless,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fain would fling the net, and fain have her free.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That Greek literature has progressed far towards the
self-conscious Alexandrian search for charm can nevertheless
be observed if we compare this passage from
Chæremon with the analogous description in Euripides’
<i>Bacchæ</i><a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> (which no doubt suggested it). There the
same general impression, and far more “atmosphere,”
is given with no voluptuous details: θαῦμ’ ἰδεῖν
εὐκοσμίας—“a marvel of grace for the eye to behold”—is
his nearest approach to Chæremon’s elaboration.
If, as has been well said,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> one may compare the three
Masters to Giotto, Raffaelle, and Correggio respectively,
then Chæremon finds his parallel among the French
painters; he reminds one not so much of the handsome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
sensuality of Boucher as of that more seductive <i>simplesse</i>
in which Greuze excelled.</p>

<p>A curious figure in this history is <span class="smcap">Dionysius</span> the
Elder, tyrant of Syracuse from 405-367 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Like
Frederick the Great of Prussia, not satisfied with political
and military glory, he aspired to literary triumphs.
With a pathetic hero-worship he purchased and treasured
the desk of Æschylus, and similar objects which had
belonged to Euripides, hoping (says Lucian<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>) to gain
inspiration from them. The prince frequently tried his
fortune at the dramatic contests in Athens, but for long
without success, and naturally became a butt of the Attic
wits, who particularly relished his moral aphorisms
(such as “tyranny is the mother of injustice”!); Eubulus
devoted a whole comedy to his tragic <i>confrère</i>. In
367 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he heard with joy that at last the first prize had
fallen to him at the Lenæa for <i>Hector’s Ransom</i>; gossip
said that his death in the same year was due to the
paroxysms of gratified vanity. Little is known about the
contents of his dramas, but we hear that one play was
an attack upon the philosopher Plato. In other works,
too, he appears to have discussed his personal interests.
Lucian preserves the bald verse:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Doris, Dionysius’ spouse, has passed away,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the astonishing remark:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! alas! a useful wife I’ve lost.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But one may be misjudging him. Perhaps by “useful”
(χρησίμην) he meant “good” (χρηστήν); Dionysius
had a curious fad for using words, not in their accepted
sense, but according to real or fancied etymology.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Ancient critics set great store by <span class="smcap">Carcinus</span>, the most
distinguished of a family long connected with the theatre.
One hundred and sixty plays are attributed to him, and
eleven victories. He spent some time at the court of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the younger Dionysius, the Syracusan tyrant, and his
longest fragment deals with the Sicilian worship of
Demeter and Persephone. We possess certain interesting
facts about his plots. Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> as an instance of
the first type of Recognition—that by signs—mentions
among those which are congenital “the stars introduced
by Carcinus in his <i>Thyestes</i>” (evidently birthmarks).
More striking is a later paragraph:<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> “In constructing
the plot and working it out with the proper diction, the
poet should place the scene, as far as possible, before his
eyes.... The need of such a rule is shown by the
fault found in Carcinus. Amphiaraus was on his way
from the temple. This fact escaped the observation of
one who did not see the situation. On the stage, however,
the piece failed, the audience being offended at the
oversight.” This shows incidentally how little assistance
an ancient dramatist obtained from that now vital collaborator,
the rehearsal. In the <i>Medea</i><a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> of Carcinus the
heroine, unlike the Euripidean, did not slay her children
but sent them away. Their disappearance caused the
Corinthians to accuse her of their murder, and she
defended herself by an ingenious piece of rhetorical
logic: “Suppose that I <i>had</i> killed them. Then it would
have been a blunder not to slay their father Jason also.
This you know I have not done. Hence I have not
murdered my children either.” Just as Carcinus there
smoothed away what was felt to be too dreadful in Euripides,
so in <i>Œdipus</i> he appears<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> to have dealt with the
improbabilities which cling to <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>. He
excelled, moreover, in the portrayal of passion: Cercyon,
struggling with horrified grief in Carcinus’ <i>Alope</i>, is cited
by Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The <i>Ærope</i> too had sensational success.
That bloodthirsty savage Alexander, tyrant of Pheræ,
was so moved by the emotion wherewith the actor
Theodorus performed his part, that he burst into tears.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Two points in his actual fragments strike a modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
reader. The first is a curious flatness of style noticeable
in the one fairly long passage; every word seems to be a
second-best. The opening lines will be sufficient:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">λέγουσι Δήμητρός ποτ’ ἄρρητον κόρην</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Πλούτωνα κρυφίοις ἁρπάσαι βουλεύμασι,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">δῦναί τε γαίας εἰς μελαμφαεῖς μυχούς.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">πόθῳ δὲ μητέρ’ ἠφανισμένης κόρης</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">μαστῆρ’ ἐπελθεῖν πᾶσαν ἐν κύκλῳ χθόνα.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To turn from this dingy verbiage to his amazing
brilliance in epigram is like passing from an auctioneer’s
showroom into a lighthouse. (The difference, we note,
is between narrative and “rhetoric”.) Such a sentence
as οὐδεὶς ἔπαινον ἡδοναῖς ἐκτήσατο (“no man ever won
praise by his pleasures”) positively bewilders by its
glitter. It is perhaps not absolutely perfect: its miraculous
ease might allow a careless reader to pass it by;
but that is a defect which Carcinus shares with most
masters of epigram, notably with Terence and Congreve.
More substantial is the wit of this fragment:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">χαίρω σ’ ὁρῶν φθονοῦντα, τοῦτ’ εἰδώς, ὅτι</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">λυπεῖ γὰρ αὐτόχρημα τοὺς κεκτημένους.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“I rejoice to see that you harbour spite, for I know that
of all its effects there is one that is just—it straightway
stings those who cherish it.” One notices the exquisite
skill which has inserted the second line, serving admirably
to prepare for and throw into relief the vigorous
third verse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theodectes</span> of Phaselis enjoyed a brilliant career.
During his forty-one years he was a pupil of Plato, Isocrates,
and Aristotle, obtained great distinction as an
orator (Cicero<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> praises him), produced fifty plays, and
obtained the first prize at eight of the thirteen contests
in which he competed. Alexander the Great decked
his statue with garlands in memory of the days when
they had studied together under Aristotle. That
philosopher quotes him several times, and in particular
pays Theodectes the high honour of coupling him with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Sophocles; the examples which he gives<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> of <i>peripeteia</i>
are the <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i> and the <i>Lynceus</i> of Theodectes.
The same drama is used<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> to exemplify another vital
point, the difference between Complication and <i>Dénouement</i>.</p>

<p>He was doubtless a brilliantly able man and a
popular dramatist with a notable talent for concocting
plots. But all that we can now see in his remains is
a feeble copy of Euripides, though he was, to be sure,
audacious enough to place Philoctetes’ wound in the
hand instead of the foot—for the sake of gracefulness,
one may imagine. For the rest, we possess a curious
speech made by some one ignorant of letters, who describes<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
as a picture the name “Theseus”—this idea is
taken bodily from Euripides—and sundry sententious
remarks, one of which surely deserves immortality as
reaching the limit of pompous common-place:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Widely through Greece hath this tradition spread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O aged man, and ancient is the saw:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hap of mortals is uncertain ever.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mention should be made of <span class="smcap">Diogenes</span> and <span class="smcap">Crates</span>
the philosophers, who wrote plays not for production,
but for the study, as propagandist pamphlets. They
may none the less have been excellent plays, like the
<i>Justice</i> of Mr. Galsworthy. Very little remains on which
an opinion can be founded. One vigorous line of
Diogenes catches the attention: “I would rather have
a drop of luck than a barrel of brains”.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>A more remarkable dramatist was <span class="smcap">Moschion</span>, whose
precise importance it is hard to estimate, though he is
deeply interesting to the historian of tragedy. For on
the one hand, he was probably not popular—nothing is
known of his life,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and Stobæus is practically the only
writer who quotes him. On the other hand, he is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
one Greek poet known to have practised definitely the
historical type of drama. Moschion is of course not
alone in selecting actual events for his theme. Long
before his day Phrynichus had produced his <i>Phœnissæ</i>
and <i>The Capture of Miletus</i>, Æschylus his <i>Persæ</i>; and
his contemporary Theodectes composed a tragedy
<i>Mausolus</i> in glorification of the deceased king of Caria.
But all four were <i>pièces d’occasion</i>. Moschion alone
practised genuine historical drama: he went according
to custom into the past for his material, but chose great
events of real history, not legend.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> His <i>Themistocles</i>
dealt with the battle of Salamis; we possess one brief
remnant thereof, in which (as it seems) a messenger
compares the victory of the small Greek force to the
devastation wrought by a small axe in a great pine-forest.
<i>The Men of Pheræ</i> appears<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> to have depicted
the brutality of Alexander, prince of Pheræ, who refused
burial to Polyphron.</p>

<p>These “burial-passages” include Moschion’s most
remarkable fragment, a fine description in thirty-three
lines describing the rise of civilization. The versification
is undesirably smooth—throughout there is not a
single resolved foot. Like a circumspect rationalist,
Moschion offers three alternative reasons, favouring
none, for the progress made by man: some great
teacher such as Prometheus, the Law of Nature
(ἀνάγκη), the long slow experience (τριβή) of the whole
race. His style here is vigorous but uneven; after
dignified lines which somewhat recall Æschylus we
find a sudden drop to bald prose: ὁ δ’ ἀσθενὴς ἦν τῶν
ἀμεινόνων βορά:<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> “the weak were the food of the
strong”.</p>

<p>It is convenient to mention here a remarkable
satyric drama, produced about 324 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the <i>Agen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
    of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
which seventeen consecutive lines survive. This play
was produced during the Dionysiac festival in the camp
of Alexander on the banks of the Hydaspes or Jhelum,
in the Punjaub. Its subject was the escapades of
Harpalus, who had revolted from Alexander and fled
to Athens. The author is said<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> to have been either
Python of Catana or Byzantium, or the Great Alexander
himself. No doubt it was an elaborate “squib” full of
racy topical allusions. Were it not that Athenæus calls
it a “satyric playlet”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> we might take the fragment as
part of a comedy. But about this time satyric drama
tended to become a form of personal attack—a dramatic
“satire”. Thus one Mimnermus, whose date is unknown,
wrote a play against doctors<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>; Lycophron and
Sositheus, both members of the Alexandrian “Pleiad,”
attacked individual philosophers, the former writing a
<i>Menedemus</i> which satirized the gluttony and drunkenness
of the amiable founder of the Eretrian school,
the latter ridiculing the disciples whom the “folly
of Cleanthes” drove like cattle—an insult which the
audience resented and damned the play.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The third century saw a great efflorescence of
theatrical activity in Alexandria. Under Ptolemy II
(285-247 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), that city became the centre of world-culture
as it already was of commerce. All artistic
forms were protected and rewarded with imperial
liberality. The great library became one of the
wonders of the world, and the Dionysiac festivals were
performed with sedulous magnificence. Among the
many writers of tragedy seven were looked on as forming
a class by themselves—the famous Pleiad (“The
Constellation of Seven”). Only five names of these
are certain—Philiscus, Homerus, Alexander, Lycophron,
and Sositheus; for the other two “chairs” various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
names are found in our authorities: Sosiphanes,
Dionysiades, Æantides, Euphronius. Nor can we be
sure that all these men worked at Alexandria.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> That
the splendour of the city and Ptolemy’s magnificent
patronage should have drawn the leading men of art,
letters, and science to the world’s centre, is a natural
assumption and indeed the fact: Theocritus the idyllist,
Euclid the geometer, Callimachus the poet and scholar,
certainly lived there. Of the Pleiad, only three are
known to have worked in Alexandria: Lycophron, to
whom Ptolemy entrusted that section of the royal library
which embraced Comedy, Alexander, who superintended
Tragedy, and Philiscus the priest of Dionysus.
Homerus may have passed all his career in Byzantium,
which later possessed a statue of him, and Sositheus
was apparently active at Athens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lycophron’s</span> <i>Menedemus</i> has already been mentioned.
His fame now rests upon the extant poem <i>Alexandra</i>,
in high repute both in ancient and in modern times for
its obscurity. But <span class="smcap">Sositheus</span> is the most interesting of
the galaxy. We may still read twenty-one lines from
his satyric drama <i>Daphnis</i> or <i>Lityerses</i>, describing with
grim vigour the ghoulish harvester Lityerses who made
his visitors reap with him, finally beheading them and
binding up the corpses in sheaves. Sositheus made his
mark, indeed, less in tragedy than in satyric writing:
he turned from the tendency of his day which made this
genre a form of satire, and went back to the antique
manner. <span class="smcap">Sosiphanes</span>, finally, deserves mention for a
remarkable fragment:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ὦ δυστυχεῖς μὲν πολλά, παῦρα δ’ ὄλβιοι</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">βροτοί, τί σεμνύνεσθε ταῖς ἐξουσίαις,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">ἢν δ’ εὐτυχῆτε, μηδὲν ὄντες εὐθέως</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“O mortal men, whose misery is so manifold, whose joys
so few, why plume yourselves on power which one day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
gives and one day destroys? If ye find prosperity,
straightway, though ye are naught, your pride rises high
as heaven, and ye see not your master death at your
elbow”—a curiously close parallel with the celebrated
outburst in <i>Measure for Measure</i>. We observe the
Euripidean versification, though Sosiphanes “flourished”
two centuries<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> after the master’s birth, and though
between the two, in men like Moschion, Carcinus, and
Chæremon, we find distinct flatness of versification.
The fourth-century poets, however second-rate, were
still working with originality of style: Sosiphanes
belongs to an age which has begun not so much to
respect as to worship the great models. He sets himself
to copy Euripides, and his iambics are naturally
“better” than Moschion’s, as are those written by
numerous able scholars of our own day.</p>

<p>After the era of the Pleiad, Greek tragedy for us to
all intents and purposes comes to an end. New dramas
seem to have been produced down to the time of Hadrian,
who died in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 138, and theatrical entertainments were
immensely popular throughout later antiquity, as vase-paintings
show, besides countless allusions in literature.
But our fragments are exceedingly meagre. One tragedy
has been preserved by its subject—the famous <i>Christus
Patiens</i> (Χριστὸς Πάσχων), which portrayed the Passion.
It is the longest and the worst of all Greek
plays, and consists largely of a repellent <i>cento</i>—snippets
from Euripides pieced together and eked out by bad
iambics of the author’s own. The result is traditionally,
but wrongly, attributed to Gregory of Nazianzus (born
probably in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 330). Its only value is that it is often
useful in determining the text of Euripides. It would
be useless to enumerate all the poetasters of these later
centuries whose names are recorded.</p>

<p class="tb">In this chapter we have constantly referred to the
<i>Poetic</i> of Aristotle, and it will be well at this point to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
summarize his view of the nature, parts, and aim of
tragedy. Before doing so, however, we must be clear
upon two points: the standpoint of his criticism and the
value of his evidence. It was long the habit to take this
work as a kind of Bible of poetical criticism, to accept
with blind devotion any statements made therein, or
even alleged<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> to be made therein, as constituting rules
for all playwrights for ever. Now, as to the former
point, the nature of his criticism, it is simply to explain
how good tragedies were as a fact written. He takes
the work of contemporary and earlier playwrights, and
in the light of this, together with his own strong common
sense, æsthetic sensibility, and private temperament,
tells how he himself (for example) would write a
tragedy. On the one hand, could he have read <i>Macbeth</i>
then, he would have condemned it; on the other, could
he read it now as a modern man, he would approve
it. As to the second point, the value of his evidence,
we must distinguish carefully between the facts which
he reports and his comment thereon. The latter we
should study with the respect due to his vast merits; but
he is not infallible. When, for instance, he writes that
“even a woman may be good, and also a slave; though
the woman may be said to be an inferior being, and the
slave quite worthless,”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and blames Euripides because
“Iphigenia the suppliant in no way resembles her later
self,”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> we shall regard him less as helping us than as
dating himself. But as to the objective facts which he
records he must be looked on as for us infallible.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
lived in or close to the periods of which he writes; he
commanded a vast array of documents now lost to us;
he was strongly desirous of ascertaining the facts; his
temperament and method were keenly scientific, his
industry prodigious. We may, and should, discuss his
opinions; his facts we cannot dispute. The reader will
be able to appreciate for himself the statement which
follows.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s definition of tragedy runs thus: “Tragedy,
then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete,
and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished
with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds
being found in separate parts of the play; in the form
of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting
the proper purgation of these emotions”.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Adequate
discussion of this celebrated passage is here impossible;
only two points can be made. Firstly, the definition
plainly applies to Greek Tragedy alone and as understood
by Aristotle: we observe the omission of what
seems to us vital—the fact that tragedy depicts the collision
of opposing principles as conveyed by the collision
of personalities—and the insertion of Greek peculiarities
since, as he goes on to explain, by “language embellished”
he means language which includes song.
Secondly, the famous dictum concerning “purgation”
(<i>catharsis</i>) is now generally understood as meaning, not
“purification” or “edification” of our pity and fear, but
as a medical metaphor signifying that these emotions
are purged out of our spirit.</p>

<p>Further light on the nature of tragedy he gives by
comparing it with three other classes of literature.
“Comedy aims at representing men as worse, Tragedy
as better than in actual life.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In another place he
contrasts tragedy with history: “It is not the function<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
of the poet to relate what has happened, but what may
happen—what is possible according to the law of probability
or necessity. The poet and the historian differ
not by writing in verse or in prose.... The true
difference is that one relates what has happened, the
other what may happen. Poetry, therefore, is a more
philosophical and a higher thing than history: for poetry
tends to express the universal, history the particular.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Our imperfect text of the treatise ends with a more
elaborate comparison between Tragedy and Epic, wherein
Aristotle combats the contemporary view<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> that “epic
poetry is addressed to a cultivated audience, who do not
need gesture; Tragedy to an inferior public. Being
then unrefined, it is evidently the lower of the two.”
His own verdict is that, since tragedy has all the epic
elements, adds to these music and scenic effects, shows
vividness in reading as well as in representation, attains
its end within narrower limits, and shows greater unity
of effect, it is the higher art.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>In various portions of the <i>Poetic</i> he gives us the
features of Tragedy, following three independent lines
of analysis:—</p>

<p>§ I. On the æsthetic line he discusses the <i>elements</i>
of a tragedy: plot, character, thought, diction, scenery,
and song. Of the last three he has little to say. But
on one of them he makes an interesting remark.
“Third in order is Thought—that is, the faculty of
saying what is possible and pertinent in given circumstances....
The older poets made their characters
speak the language of civic life; the poets of our
time, the language of the rhetoricians.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> This prophesies
from afar of Seneca and his like. As for character, it
must be good, appropriate, true to life, and consistent.</p>

<p>Concerning Plot, which he rightly calls “the soul
of a tragedy,”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Aristotle is of course far more copious.
The salient points alone can be set down here:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “The proper magnitude is comprised within
such limits, that the sequence of events, according to
the law of probability or necessity, will admit of a
change from bad fortune to good, or from good fortune
to bad.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “The plot ... must imitate one action and
that a whole, the structural union of the parts being
such that if anyone of them is displaced or removed,
the whole will be disjointed and disturbed.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> A tragedy
must be an organism. It therefore follows that “of
all plots and actions the episodic are the worst ...
in which the episodes or acts succeed one another
without probable or necessary sequence”.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> He is
recommending the “Unity of Action”.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “Plots are either Simple or Complex.... An
action ... I call Simple, when the change of fortune
takes place without Reversal (or Recoil) of the Action
and without Recognition. A Complex Action is one
in which the change is accompanied by such Reversal,
or by Recognition, or by both.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Reversal we shall
meet again. By Recognition Aristotle means not
merely such Recognition-scenes as we find in the
crisis of the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> (though such are the
best) but “a change from ignorance to knowledge,
producing love or hate between the persons destined
by the poet for good or bad fortune”.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) “Two parts, then, of the plot—Reversal and
Recognition—turn upon surprises. A third part is
the Tragic Incident. The Tragic Incident is a distinctive
or painful action, such as death on the stage,
bodily agony, wounds, and the like.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In the words
“death on the stage”—or “before the audience” (the
phrase<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> has no bearing on the stage-controversy),
Aristotle casually but completely overthrows another
critical convention, that in ancient Tragedy deaths
take place only “behind the scenes”. In the extant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
plays, not only do Alcestis and Hippolytus “die on
the stage” in their litters, but Ajax falls upon his
sword.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The best subject of Tragedy is the change from
good fortune to bad in the life of some eminent man
not conspicuously good and just, whose misfortune,
however, is due not to wickedness but to some error
or weakness.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The poet “may not indeed destroy the framework
of the received legends—the fact, for instance,
that Clytæmnestra was slain by Orestes and Eriphyle
by Alcmæon—but he ought to show invention of his
own, and skilfully handle the traditional material”.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
This injunction was obeyed beforehand by all the three
Athenian masters; it is especially important to remember
it when studying Euripides.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) “The unravelling of the plot ... must arise out
of the plot itself; it must not be brought about by the
<i>Deus ex Machina</i>, as in the Medea.... The <i>Deus ex
Machina</i> should be employed only for events external
to the drama—for antecedent or subsequent events,
which lie beyond the range of human knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
This vital criticism will be considered later, when we
discuss the <i>Philoctetes</i><a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> of Sophocles and the Euripidean
drama.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) “Within the action there must be nothing irrational.
If the irrational cannot be excluded, it should
be outside the scope of the tragedy. Such is the
irrational element in the Œdipus of Sophocles.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Aristotle means certain strange <i>data</i> in the <i>Œdipus
Tyrannus</i>—the fact that neither Œdipus nor Jocasta
has learnt earlier about the past, and so forth.</p>

<p>§ II. On the purely literary line he tells us the
parts:—<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “The Prologos is that entire part of a tragedy
which precedes the Parodos of the chorus” (see below
for the Parodos). Thus a drama may have no “prologos”
at all, for example the <i>Persæ</i>. The implications
of our word “prologue” are derived from the practice
of Euripides, who is fond of giving in his “prologos”
an account of events which have led up to the action
about to be displayed.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “The Episode is that entire part of a tragedy
which is between complete choric songs.” “Episodes”
then are what we call “acts”: the name has already
been explained.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “The Exodos is that entire part of a tragedy
which has no choric song after it.” The few anapæsts
which close most tragedies are not “choric songs”—they
were performed in recitative. Thus the Exodos
is simply the last act.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) “Of the choric part the Parodos is the first undivided
utterance of the chorus: the Stasimon is a
choric ode without anapæsts or trochees: the Commos
is a joint lamentation of chorus and actors.” It will be
seen later<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> that by excluding trochees he probably
means the trochaic tetrameter as seen in dialogue; lyric
trochees are very common.</p>

<p>§ III. On the strictly dramatic line he tells us the
<i>stages of structural development</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “Every tragedy falls into two parts—Complication
and Unravelling (or <i>Dénouement</i>).... By the
Complication I mean all that comes between the beginning
of the action and the part which marks the turning-point
to good or bad fortune. The Unravelling is
that which comes between the beginning of the change
and the end.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “Reversal (or Recoil, Peripeteia) is a change
by which a train of action produces the opposite of the
effect intended, subject always to our rule of probability
or necessity. Thus in the Œdipus, the messenger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
comes to cheer Œdipus and free him from his alarms
about his mother, but, by revealing who he is, he produces
the opposite effect.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Much might be written on this analysis of dramatic
structure. One remark at least must be made. It is
not plain how much importance Aristotle allots to the
Recoil or Peripeteia. We have seen that he did not
regard it as indispensable. At the most he seems to
think it a striking way of starting the <i>dénouement</i>. It
is better to look upon it, and the action which leads up
to it, as a separate part of the drama—and it may be
argued that every tragedy, if not every comedy, has a
Peripeteia—to form, in fact, that middle stage which
elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> in the <i>Poetic</i> he mentions as necessary.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GREEK THEATRE AND THE PRODUCTION OF PLAYS</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Occasions of Performance</span></h3>

<p>Greek drama was looked upon not only as a
form of entertainment and culture, but as an
act of worship offered to the god Dionysus.
It was, in consequence, restricted to his festivals; performances
of a quite secular character are unknown.
Three Attic festivals are connected with the tragic
drama: the City Dionysia, the Lenæa, the Rural
Dionysia. The City or Great Dionysia were the most
splendid of the three, held in the precinct of Dionysus
Eleuthereus on the south-eastern slope of the Acropolis,
where the ruined theatre still lies. Tragedies, comedies,
and dithyrambs were performed, but of these tragedy
was the most important. The time was the month of
Elaphebolion (March to April). The Lenæa or
“Wine-Press Festival” which occurred in Gamelion
(January to February) was the great occasion for
comedy, though tragedies were also to be seen. It was
held at first in the Lenæon, a sacred enclosure, the site
of which is still uncertain, later in the same theatre as
tragedy. The Rural Dionysia fell in Poseideon (December
to January), and were celebrated by the various
Attic townships, especially the Peiræus; most of the
dramas performed were probably such as had been successful
in Athens itself; companies of actors travelled
about the country for this purpose.</p>

<p>Of these three celebrations the City Dionysia were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the most important for tragedy. The tyrant Pisistratus
greatly increased the splendour of this festival and
instituted the tragic contest. Each year during the fifth
century three tragedians submitted each a tetralogy, and
five comedians one play apiece. Tragedies were given
in the mornings, comedies in the afternoon, and the
celebration continued for at least five days.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Buildings</span></h3>

<p>Since the performance was a state-function, the
whole nation was theoretically expected to be present,
and in point of fact enormous audiences attended:
the great theatre accommodated perhaps 30,000<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> spectators.
This fact governs the nature of the whole
presentation. The theatre could not be roofed, and the
acting therefore differed greatly from that customary
in modern buildings.</p>

<p>A Greek theatre consisted of three parts—the auditorium,
the orchestra, and the “stage-buildings”. The
heart of the whole is the orchestra or “dancing-ground”
(ὀρχήστρα) upon which the chorus, throughout the
action, were stationed—a circular area of beaten earth,
later paved with marble. Beside the altar in this
orchestra stood, in the earliest days of the theatre, the
sacrificial table upon which the single actor mounted.
This table in the fixed theatre is the descendant of the
waggon from which the peripatetic actor of Thespis
delivered his lines. In addition to the celebrants the
passive worshippers were needed—the audience. Therefore
the orchestra was placed at the bottom of a slope;
and the spectators stood or sat on the higher ground.
On the farther side rose the “stage-buildings,” whatever
from time to time they were. The general plan,
then, of any Greek theatre was this:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp95" id="theatre-plan" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/theatre-plan.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p>A is the circular orchestra, B the altar (θυμέλη) of Dionysus
which invariably stood in the middle of it. C represents
the “stage-buildings”; D, E, F, are the doors
which led from the building to the open air. The building
usually projected into side-wings (G, G), called
παρασκήνια. H, H, are the passage-ways (πάροδοι), by
which the chorus generally entered the orchestra, and
by which the audience always made its way to the seats.
J, J, J, is the auditorium, a vast horseshoe-shaped space
rising up a hillside from the orchestra, and filled with
benches. This space was intersected by gangways,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
K, K, L, L, etc., called, perhaps, κλίμακες; the areas M,
M, N, N, etc., so formed, had the name “pegs” (κερκίδες).
In most theatres a longitudinal gallery O, O, O, was
made for further convenience in getting to the seats.
In the strictly Greek type the front line of “stage-buildings”
never encroached on the circle of the orchestra.
But these theatres were used in Roman times also, and
altered to suit certain needs. The front of C was
thrown forward so that it cut into the orchestra and
obliterated the passages H, H. To replace these,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
entrances were tunnelled through the auditorium. Thus
at Athens the orchestra is now only little more than a
semicircle, though amid the ruins of the “stage-buildings”
can still be seen a few feet of the kerbstone which
surrounded the original dancing floor—the only surviving
remnants of the Æschylean theatre; this masonry shows
that the diameter of the whole was about 90 feet.</p>

<p>The “stage-buildings,” as we have called them for
convenience, require a longer discussion. Originally
there stood in that place only a tent, called <i>scēnē</i> (σκηνή),
which took no part in the theatrical illusion, but was used
by the one actor simply as a dressing-room. Soon, no
doubt, came the important advance of employing it as
“scenery”—the tent of Agamemnon before Troy, for example.
Later a wooden booth was erected, and
Sophocles’ invention of scene-painting—that is, of concealing
this booth with canvas to represent whatever
place or building was needed—added enormously to the
playwright’s resources. This booth was afterwards built
of stone and became more and more elaborate; Roman
“stage-buildings” survive which are admirable pieces of
dignified architecture. The building of course contained
dressing-rooms and property-rooms. There were doors
at the narrow ends. The front of the building was
pierced by three, later by five, doors.</p>

<p>Upon what did these doors open? Was there a stage
in the Greek theatre? This problem has aroused more
discussion than any other in Greek scholarship save the
“Homeric Question”. That all theatres possessed a
stage (λογεῖον) in Roman times is certain; the Athenian
building—which in its present condition dates from the
alterations made by Phædrus in the third century
after Christ—shows quite obviously the front wall of a
stage about 4½ feet high. But did the dramatists of
the fifth and fourth centuries before Christ write for a
theatre with a stage or not? There is a good deal of
<i>prima-facie</i> evidence for a stage, and a good deal to show
that the actors moved to and fro on that segment of the
orchestra nearest to the booth. That is, the question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
lies between acting on top of the proscenium (or decorated
wall joining the faces of the <i>parascenia</i> G, G) and
acting in front of it. A brief <i>résumé</i><a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> of the evidence is
all that can be attempted here. It is confined to the
consideration of the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, to
which belongs practically all the extant work. For the
period after 300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the use of a stage seems indisputable.</p>

<h4>A. <span class="smcap">Arguments For a Stage</span></h4>

<p>§ 1. <i>A High Stage.</i>—Vitruvius, the Roman architect,
who wrote at the end of the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, in his
directions for building a Greek theatre says: “Among
the Greeks the orchestra is wider, the back scene is
farther from the audience, and the stage is narrower.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
This latter they call <i>logeion</i> (speaking-place), because the
actors of tragedy and comedy perform there close to the
back scene, while the other artistes play in the ambit of
the orchestra, wherefore the two classes of performer are
called <i>scænici</i> and <i>thymelici</i> respectively.” [Literally,
“those connected with the booth” and “those connected
with the central altar”.] “This <i>logeion</i> should be not less
than 10, and not more than 12, feet in height.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This,
says Dörpfeld, applies to the Greek theatre of Vitruvius’
own time, but has been extended by modern writers to
the fifth century. Supposing, however, that Vitruvius
was thinking of the fifth century, then:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The stage is too narrow for performances, viz.
2·50 to 3 mètres, from which 1 mètre must be subtracted
for the background. The remaining space is
not enough for actors and mutes, not to mention any
combined action of players and chorus.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It is also too high. Many passages in the plays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
show that chorus and actors are on the same level; in
all these cases the chorus would have to mount steps, or
the actors descend. This is absurdly awkward; nor is
there evidence for steps. An attempt has been made<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> to
meet the difficulties by the assumption of another platform
about half the height of the stage, erected on the
orchestra for the chorus. But the various objections to
such a subsidiary platform are so strong that it is no
longer believed in. With it, however disappears the
only way by which plays with a chorus could be performed
on the high stage of Vitruvius.</p>

<p>§ 2. <i>A Low Stage.</i>—Many scholars, abandoning
Vitruvius as evidence for the fifth century, postulate a
low stage. Their arguments are:—<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Aristotle in the fourth century calls the songs of
the actors τὰ ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς, and says that the actor
performed ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς, phrases which seem to mean
“from the stage” and “on the stage” respectively.
And though Dörpfeld would take σκηνή as “background”
(not “stage”) translating Aristotle’s phrases
by “from the background” and “at the background,”
there remains the difficulty that Aristotle plainly thinks
of actors and chorus as occupying quite distinct stations,
which scarcely suggests that they move on contiguous
portions of the same ground.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The side-wings or <i>parascenia</i> must have been
meant to enclose a stage. What else could have been
their use?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) There are five phrases used by Aristophanes.
Three times<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> an actor, on approaching other actors, is
said to “come up”; twice<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> he is said to “go down”.
Nothing in the context implies raised ground as needed
by the drama, so that we seem forced to refer these
expressions to the visible stage itself. Dörpfeld and
others would translate these two verbs by “come here”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and “go away”; but there is no evidence for these
meanings.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The existing plays throw incidental light on the
problem:—</p>

<p>(i) Certain characters<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> complain of the steepness of
their path as they first come before the audience. Do
they not refer to an actual ascent from orchestra to
stage?</p>

<p>(ii) Ghosts sometimes appear. How can they have
ascended out of “the ground” unless action took place
on a raised area? This argument is, however, not
strong. In later theatres such spectres did rise from
below. But in the fifth century they may well have
walked in.</p>

<p>(iii) A more striking<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> argument is that on several
occasions the chorus, though it has excellent reason to
enter the back scene, remains inert. In the <i>Agamemnon</i>
the elders talk of rushing to the king’s aid; a
similar thing happens in the <i>Medea</i>; there are a number
of such strange features. The inference is that there
was a stage, to mount which would have appeared odd.</p>

<p>(iv) A stage was needed to make the actors visible,
instead of being hidden by the chorus.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> But, though
there is no evidence that the chorus grouped themselves
about the orchestra (as in the performances at Bradfield
College), and they apparently stood in rows facing the
actors, they could have been placed far forward enough
to enable all to see the actors. Anyone who has visited
a circus will appreciate this.</p>

<p>(v) Plato<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> remarks that Agathon and his actors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
appeared on an ὀκρίβας, a “platform”. But the word
suggests a slight structure: Dörpfeld objects that this
appearance was probably in the Odeum, or Music Hall,
not the Theatre of Dionysus; if it was in the theatre,
the passage rather tells against a stage, for a temporary
platform would not have been used if there was a
stage.</p>

<p>(vi) Horace<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> says that “Æschylus gave his modest
stage a floor of beams” or “gave the stage a floor of
moderate-sized beams”. Dörpfeld alleges (without evidence)
that <i>pulpitum</i> (translated “stage” in the last
sentence) may mean “booth,” and suggests that the
poet assumes a stage as matter of course: he is marking
the advance made by Æschylus upon Thespis,
who (according to Horace himself), performed his plays
upon a waggon. But the proper answer is surely that
Horace is regularly unreliable when he deals with questions
of Greek scholarship, and that he is no doubt
arbitrarily combining his knowledge of contemporary
Greek theatres with his knowledge that Æschylus advanced
in theatrical matters beyond Thespis.</p>

<p>Such are the main arguments in favour of a stage in
the fifth and fourth centuries before Christ.</p>

<h4>B. <span class="smcap">Arguments Against a Stage</span></h4>

<p>(i) The evidence of the extant dramas. This,
already adduced by many to prove that a stage was
used, is taken by Dörpfeld<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> as “showing unmistakably
that no separation existed between chorus and actors,
that on the contrary both played on the same area”.
He refers to action where people pass between house
and orchestra with no apparent difficulty or hesitation.
The chorus enter from the “palace” in the <i>Choephorœ</i>,
the <i>Eumenides</i>, and Euripides’ <i>Phaethon</i>; the chorus
of huntsmen enter it in the <i>Hippolytus</i>. There are
other probable or possible instances. Particularly noteworthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
is the fact that in <i>Helena</i> the chorus in the
midst of the play enter the building, and later reappear
from it.</p>

<p>(ii) The tradition in later writers. It is true, says
Dörpfeld, that we have no express assertion that there
was no stage—it never occurred to the older writers
to say so, for they knew of no such thing. The later
writers imply that there was none. Timæus,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> commenting
on ὀκρίβας, says: “for there was not yet a
<i>thymele</i>”. <i>Thymele</i> there means “stage”. Several
late writers tell us that the Roman <i>logeion</i> (“speaking-place”
or “stage”) was once called “orchestra”: this
supports the view that the stage is part of the old
orchestra, higher than the other portion (see below).
The scholiast on <i>Prometheus Vinctus</i>, 128, remarks:
“They (the chorus) say this as they hover in the
air on the machine; for it would be absurd for them
to converse from below [<i>i.e.</i> from the orchestra] to
one aloft”. Now, the pro-stage theory makes all
choruses do this. The scholiast on Aristophanes’
<i>Wasps</i>, 1342, writes: “The old man stands on a certain
height (ἐπί τινος μετεώρου) as he summons the girl”.
The word “certain” (τινός) implies that he knew
nothing of a regular stage. Finally, if there was a
definite and regular difference of position between
actors and chorus, is it not astonishing (<i>a</i>) that there
is in Greek literature no certain allusion to the fact,
(<i>b</i>) that the older literature contains no word for the
stage, the place where the acting was performed being
referred to merely by reference to the <i>booth</i> (ἐπὶ σκηνῆς
and ἀπὸ σκηνῆς)?</p>

<p>(iii) The architectural remains. Dörpfeld sums up
his celebrated architectural researches thus. No theatre
survives from the fifth century, but the theatre of
Lycurgus (fourth century) belongs to a period when
the plays of that century were still acted in the old
manner. Also we possess numerous buildings which
represent the rather later form of the theatre (the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
building with fixed proscenium), and which belong
to that period to which the remarks of Vitruvius
apply. From the Lycurgean theatre we learn that
there was no stage high or low. A platform for
actor or orator is only necessary when the audience
are all on a flat area. If they sit on a slope, a stage
is more inconvenient than if the speaker stands on
the ground.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> And so, in the earliest times, when
there was no sloping auditorium, Thespis, for example,
performed upon a cart. In Italy the slope came into
use only late, and the stage had been widely adopted
before that time—for there was no chorus to provide
for. When the Greek theatre was introduced into
Italy, the Roman form was invented. They did not
abandon their own stage, but divided the Greek
orchestra into two parts of different height. The
farther half, now superfluous (the chorus having
vanished) could be used for spectators or gladiators.
This portion was (in earlier theatres of the true Greek
type) excavated and filled with fresh seats. The
stage was, of course, not made higher than the lowest
eyes.</p>

<p>The nature of the proscenium in Greek theatres
was not suitable for the supporting wall of a stage. It
would be absurd to see a temple in the air above a
colonnade.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Again, it was impossible to act on top of
the proscenium. The fear of falling, when the actor
wore a mask and was forced to approach the edge in
order to be well seen by the lowest spectators, would
spoil his acting. Finally, why was the proscenium-front
not a tangent of the orchestra circle? It should have
been brought as far forward as possible if they acted on
top of it.</p>

<p>To sum up. The orchestra in the earliest period
was the place of the chorus and the actors. It kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
that function when the <i>scēnē</i> was erected beside it as
a background. The chorus used the whole circle, the
actors only part of it and the ground which lay in front
of the <i>scēnē</i>. No change in this arrangement was made
later. The actors in Roman times, of course, stood
above the level of the excavated semicircle. But they
remained throughout at the same distance from the
spectators<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and at the same level—that of the old
orchestra.</p>

<p>How then are we to deal with Vitruvius’ statement
about the height of the stage? Dörpfeld suggested<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
that Vitruvius used plans and descriptions made by a
Greek; Vitruvius, in absence of any warning, taking it
(as a Roman) for granted there was a stage, saw it in
the proscenium; or he may have misunderstood the
phrase ἐπὶ σκηνῆς in his Greek authority. But such
a fundamental error made by a professional architect,
who even if he had never been in Greece, must have
known many persons familiar with Greek acting, is
extremely hard to assume.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Yet the mistake is credible
as regards the Greek theatre of the fourth and fifth
centuries.</p>

<p>Amidst the mass of evidence and argument, only an
outline of which is here presented, it is difficult to decide.
The majority of inquirers will probably be swayed as
regards the theatre of Sophocles and Astydamas by two
considerations: the acting exigencies of the plays we
now read or know of, and their own feeling as to how
the performance would look with a stage and without.
It seems, perhaps, most likely that Dörpfeld is right: that
there was no stage, though when the façade represented
a palace or temple a few steps might naturally appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Supervision of Dramatic Displays</span></h3>

<p>The authority superintending dramatic performances
was the Athenian State, acting through the archon basileus
for the Lenæa, the archon eponymus for the City
Dionysia. The archon allotted the task of producing
the three annual series of dramas to three persons for
each series: the poet, the choregus, the protagonist.
We will consider these persons in turn.</p>

<p>Playwrights submitted their work to the archon, who
himself selected three: to each he was said to “give a
chorus”. The applications were many, and distinguished
poets sometimes failed to “receive a chorus”. The
poet’s business was not only to write the play and the
music, (but in early times) to train actors and chorus.
Near the end of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it became the
practice to employ an expert trainer. Occasionally the
poet caused some other person to “produce” the play.
This was frequently done by Aristophanes, and we hear
that Iophon competed with tragedies written by his
father Sophocles.</p>

<p>The name “choregus” means “chorus-leader,” but
the choregus actually had quite other functions. He
was a rich citizen who as a “liturgy” or public service
bore all the special cost of the performance. To each
choregus a flute-player was allotted, and it seems likely
that the poet too was regarded as assigned to the
choregus rather than the latter to the poet. The mounting
of plays, which depended on the choregus, greatly
influenced the audience, and their expressed opinion
cannot but have had weight with the ten judges.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The
wealthy Nicias, for example, obtained success for every
tetralogy which he mounted.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The third person with whom the archon concerned
himself was the “protagonist” (the chief actor)—after
the middle of the fifth century; before then it appears
that poets chose their protagonists. In the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the fifth century a protagonist was selected by the
archon and one assigned to each tragic poet by lot.
(The chief actor provided his subordinates himself.)
This change came at about the time when three actors
were regularly employed in each tragedy and when the
contests in acting were instituted; a prize for acting
was awarded, and the successful actor had the right to
perform the following year. As the importance of the
actor increased—Aristotle tells us that in his time the
success of a play depended more upon the actor than
upon the poet<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>—it was considered unfair that one poet
should have the best performer for all his plays. In
the middle of the fourth century the arrangement was
introduced that each protagonist should play in one
tragedy only of each poet.</p>

<p>Each dramatist competed with a tetralogy<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> (that is,
“four works”) consisting of three tragedies and a satyric
play, and the claims of these three tetralogies were
decided by five<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> judges. Some days before the competition
began, the Council of the State and the choregi
selected a number of names from each of the ten tribes.
These names were sealed up in urns, which were produced
at the opening of the festival. The archon drew
one name from each urn, and the ten citizens so selected
were sworn as judges and given special seats. After
the conclusion of the performances each of the ten gave
his verdict on a tablet, and five of these were drawn
by the archon at random; these five judgments gave
the award. In this method the principle of democratic
equality and the necessity to rely on expert opinion were
well combined. When the votes had been collected, a
herald proclaimed the name of the successful poet and
of his choregus, who were crowned with ivy (a plant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
always associated with Dionysus). There is no evidence
that a dramatic choregus was given any further
reward: the prize of a tripod was only for dithyramb.
The poet received, tradition said, a goat<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> in early times;
after the State-supervision began, a sum of money from
public funds was paid to each of the competitors.
Records of the results were inscribed upon tablets and
set up both by the victorious choregi and by the State.
It is from these, directly or indirectly, that our knowledge
of the facts is obtained; directly, because such
inscriptions have been discovered in Athens, indirectly,
because they were the basis of written works on the
subject. Aristotle wrote a book called <i>Didascaliæ</i>
(διδασκαλίαι), that is, “Dramatic Productions”; though
it is lost, later works were based upon it, and it is from
these that the Greek “Arguments” to the existing plays
are derived.</p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">The Mounting of a Tragedy</span></h3>

<p>Scenery was painted on canvas or boards and attached
to the front of the buildings. In satyric drama
it appears to have varied little—a wild district with
trees, rocks, and a cave. Tragedy generally employed
a temple or palace-front, though even in the extant
thirty-two there are exceptions—the rock of Prometheus,
the tent of Ajax, the cave of Philoctetes, and so forth.
In a façade there were three doors, corresponding to
the three permanent doors in the buildings; when a
cave or tent was depicted, its opening was in front of
the central door. Statues were placed before the temple
or palace—those of the deities, for instance, in the
<i>Agamemnon</i> to whom the Herald utters his magnificent
address. Individuality would be given to a temple by
the statue of a particular god. Scene-painting was
probably not very artistic or scrupulous of details. We
never read any praise of splendid theatrical scenery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
such as is familiar to-day; and clever lighting effects
were of course out of the question when all was performed
in the daylight. Here and there the persons
allude to the landscape, as in Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i>, where
the aged attendant of Orestes points out to the prince
striking features of the Argolid plain. Such things
were mostly left to the imagination of the audience, like
the forest of Arden and the squares of Verona or Venice
in Shakespeare. Undoubtedly, a Greek tragedy provided
a beautiful spectacle, but this resulted from the
costumes, poses, and grouping of actors and chorus.</p>

<p>Change of scene was rarely needed in tragedy; the
peculiar arrangements of comedy do not concern us.
Only two extant tragedies need it. In the <i>Eumenides</i>
of Æschylus the change from the temple of Apollo at
Delphi to Athena’s temple in Athens is vital to the plot
but need not have caused much trouble; probably convention
was satisfied by changing the statue. In <i>Ajax</i>
the scene shifts from that hero’s tent to a deserted part
of the sea-shore; no doubt the tent was simply removed.
One reason against change of scene was the continuous
presence of the chorus; when the playwright found
he must shift his locality the chorus were compelled
to retire and reappear. We read<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> of a permanent
appliance by which scenery could be altered; there is,
however, no evidence that it was known in the great
age of Athenian drama. This consisted of the <i>periacti</i>
(περίακτοι). At each end of the scene stood wooden
triangular prisms standing on their ends and revolving
in sockets, so arranged that one of the narrow oblong
sides continued the picture. A different subject was
painted on each side. A twist given to either marked
a change of place; the alteration of one <i>periactus</i> meant
a change of locality within the same region, while the
alteration of both meant a complete change of district.
Thus, had this contrivance been used in the fifth century,
one <i>periactus</i> would have been moved in the <i>Ajax</i>, both
in the <i>Eumenides</i>. Another and stranger use of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
contrivance is mentioned by Pollux: “it introduces
sea-gods and everything which is too heavy for the
machine”. We shall return to this when we come to
the “eccyclema” and the “machine”. No curtain is
known for the classical age.</p>

<p>Stage-properties were few and for the most part
simple. Much the most important was the tomb of
some great person; that of Darius in the <i>Persæ</i>, and
of Agamemnon in the <i>Choephorœ</i>, are fundamental to
the plot, and there are many other examples.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Statues
have already been mentioned. The spaciousness of the
orchestra made it easy to introduce chariots and horses,
as in <i>Agamemnon</i>, Euripides’ <i>Electra</i> and <i>Iphigenia at
Aulis</i>.</p>

<p>Various contrivances were employed to permit the
appearance of actors in circumstances where they could
not simply enter the orchestra or <i>logeion</i>. We need
not dwell upon certain quaint machinery which it is
fairly certain was not used in the great age—“Charon’s
steps,” by which ghosts ascended, the “anapiesma”
which brought up river-gods and Furies, the “stropheion”
which showed heroes in heaven and violent
deaths, the “hemicyclion” by which the spectators
were given a view of remote cities or of men swimming,
the “bronteion,” or thunder machine, consisting of a
sheet of metal and sacks of stones to throw thereon,
the “ceraunoscopeion” or lightning machine, a black
plank with a flash painted upon it, which was shot
across the stage. In the fifth century the theatrical
contrivances amounted to four—the distegia, the theologeion,
the “machine,” and the eccyclema.</p>

<p>The distegia was employed when human beings
showed themselves above the level of the “stage,” for
example on a roof or cliff. Such appearances are not
common—the watchman (<i>Agamemnon</i>), Antigone and
her nurse (<i>Phœnissæ</i>), Orestes and Pylades (<i>Orestes</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Evadne (Euripidean <i>Supplices</i>), are all the occasions
in existing tragedy; comedy supplies a few more.
Probably it was “a projecting balcony or upper story,
which might be introduced when required”;<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> the word
appears to mean “second story”. The arrangement
would then correspond closely to the gallery used at
the back of the Elizabethan stage.</p>

<p>Similar to this was the “theologeion” (“speaking-place
for gods”), on which gods or deified heroes
appeared when they were not to be shown descending
through the air. The arrangement seems to have
been a platform in the upper part of the scenery.
Whether it was fixed there and the actors entered
through an opening to take their place, or whether
it was used like the eccyclema (see below), is not clear.</p>

<p>We hear much more of the “machine” (μηχανή)
by which actors descended as from Heaven or ascended.
It was a crane from which cords were attached to the
actor’s body; a stage-hand hauled the actor up or down
by a winch. There are a good many instances of its
use. The apparition of Thetis at the close of <i>Andromache</i>
exemplifies the most customary happening. But
sometimes the machine had to carry a greater burden;
both the Dioscuri appear in Euripides’ <i>Electra</i>, both
Iris and Frenzy in <i>Hercules Furens</i>. Æschylus no
doubt sent Oceanus on his four-legged bird by this
route; possibly Medea, and the chariot containing her
sons’ bodies, were also suspended by it; and it has
even been thought that the chorus of <i>Prometheus
Vinctus</i> and their “winged chariot” enter in this way.
But the last suggestion is very questionable. The
weight would be excessive, and probably the car is
supposed to be left outside, or may have been painted
on a <i>periactus</i>. Aristophanes gets excellent fooling
out of the machine. The celebrated basket in which
Socrates “walks the air and contemplates the sun”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
is attached to it; and in the <i>Peace</i> there is a delightful
parody of Bellerophon’s ascent to Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Far more puzzling is the eccyclema. This celebrated
device was employed to reveal to the spectators
events which had just taken place “within”. After the
murders in the <i>Agamemnon</i> the palace doors are opened
and Clytæmnestra is shown standing axe in hand over
the corpses of Cassandra and the king. There are a
good many instances of precisely the same type: the
scene exhibited is a small <i>tableau</i>. But there are dissimilar
examples which shall be discussed later. The
construction of this machine is usually described thus.
Inside the middle<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> door was a small oblong platform on
wheels, upon which the <i>tableau</i> was arranged; then the
platform was thrust out upon the stage and in a few
minutes drawn back again. Two quite different objections
have been raised to this account.</p>

<p>First, it seems ridiculous to reveal what is supposed
to be inside a building—not to come out, be it observed,
but to stay inside—by thrusting forth one or two people
on a species of dray. But we must remember the
enormous and rightful influence of convention. If
Greek audiences wished to see such <i>tableaux</i> and were
convinced that by no other means could they be shown,
then it was their business to accept the eccyclema; that
in such circumstances they would accept and soon fail
even to notice it, is proved by the whole history of art.
We see nothing ludicrous in the spectacle of a man
telling his deepest secrets in a study one wall of which
is replaced by a vast assembly of eavesdroppers. The
Elizabethan theatre accepted precisely this contrivance
of the eccyclema. In our texts of <i>Henry VI</i> (Pt. II,
Act III, Sc. ii.) we read this stage-direction: “The
folding-doors of an inner chamber are thrown open, and
Gloucester is discovered dead in his bed: Warwick and
others standing by it”. Instead of all this, the old
direction merely says: “Bed put forth”. In another
early drama we find the amusing instruction: “Enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
So-and-So in bed”. The æsthetic objection to the
eccyclema has no force whatever.</p>

<p>The other objection rests on the fact that a more
elaborate <i>tableau</i> is sometimes indicated than could be
accommodated on so narrow a platform. The most
serious example is provided by the <i>Eumenides</i>, where
we are to imagine upon the eccyclema an altar, Orestes
kneeling by it, Apollo and Hermes standing beside him,
and the whole chorus of Furies sleeping around them.
In Aristophanes’ <i>Clouds</i> the interior of Socrates’ school
is exhibited, with pupils at work amid lecture-room
appliances. A brilliant scene of the same poet’s <i>Acharnians</i>
depicts Dicæopolis’ interview with Euripides,
who is too busy to come downstairs from his study-attic,
but consents to be “wheeled out”. Thus the eccyclema
shows him outside and also aloft: how could this be
represented on the dray? Perhaps by elevating poet and
furniture upon posts? Even this is not inconceivable.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
Nor is it impossible that the Furies of the <i>Eumenides</i>
were arranged on two eccyclemata of their own, thrust
out of the side doors, while Orestes and the gods were
upon the central platform. For Pollux does say that
there were three.</p>

<p>Other views of this machine have been offered, which
explain the “wheeling” of which we read as the working
of wheeled mechanism, such as a winch. Some
would have it that the scenery opens, whether doors are
flung wide, or the canvas is rolled back like curtains.
In this way a considerable area behind the scenes could
be revealed. This is, of course, infinitely more in
accordance with modern ideas. But it will not fit all
the available evidence, which talks of “wheeling in” and
“wheeling out,” “Roll this unhappy man within”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and
the like. Moreover, in such a simple operation there
would be nothing for Aristophanes to parody. A third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
explanation is that a considerable part of the back scene
was cut out and replaced so as to swing on a perpendicular
axis. Projecting from this at the back was a small
platform, upon which the <i>tableau</i> was grouped; this
oblong portion was twisted round so that the platform
pointed towards the spectators. It resembled, in fact,
that contrivance in the modern Japanese theatre by
which one scene is prepared while the preceding action
takes place, and is swung into position when needed.
A grave objection to this is that some of the groups—those
in <i>Eumenides</i> and <i>Acharnians</i>—would be too
large for such a contrivance. The best view seems to
be the traditional, to which the evidence strongly points.
As for the large scenes so displayed, various tolerable
explanations may be found. Only one or two Furies
and Socratic novices may have appeared on the platform,
and the others may have simply walked in through
the right and left doors, or even been shown on subsidiary
platforms at those entrances.</p>

<p>All other appurtenances of a performance were provided
by the choregus—such things as chariots and
animals, and, far the most important, costumes of chorus
and actors. All dramatic performers, both actors and
chorus in tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama alike,
wore disguise throughout the whole history of the ancient
theatre. The reason in the first place was that masks
or some kind of facial disguise—in Thespis’ time the
face was anointed with lees of wine—was a feature of
Dionysiac worship. The dressing of a tragic chorus
was generally a simple matter. It often represented a
company of people from the district with no special
characteristics. The dress was therefore the usual dress
of Greek men or women, with a special shoe, the <i>crēpis</i>
(κρηπίς), said to have been introduced by Sophocles.
There were also obvious indications of circumstances;
old men wore beards and carried staves; suppliants
bore olive-branches twined with wool. The occasional
choruses of peculiar character were of course equipped
specially. In Euripides’ <i>Bacchæ</i> they were dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
fawn-skins and carried timbrels. When Æschylus
brought out his <i>Eumenides</i> he designed the Furies’
costume himself; their terrible masks and the snakes
entwined in their hair are said to have terrified the
spectators and produced most untoward effects on the
more susceptible. The equipment of satyric choristers
was very different. They were always dressed as
satyrs or goat-men. A tight garment, representing the
naked flesh, covered their bodies. Their masks were
surmounted by horns, their feet were shod in hoof-shaped
shoes, and round their middle they wore a
woollen girdle like goatskin to which were attached the
phallus and a tail, which, however, after about 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
resembled the tail of a horse, not a goat, the satyr-type
being superseded by the Silenus-type. Satyric actors
seem to have worn much the same costume as the tragic,
save that the dress of Silenus represented the hides of
animals.</p>

<p>The dress of tragic actors was mostly the invention
of Æschylus and showed little change throughout
ancient times. Everything was done to make the
actor’s appearance as stately as possible. His robes were
heavy, sweeping, and of brilliant colours. His size was
increased by various devices. The boot, the famous
<i>cothurnus</i> (κόθορνος) or buskin, had an immensely thick
sole; the limbs were padded and the height was further
increased by an <i>oncus</i> (ὄγκος) or projection of the mask
above the forehead. The mask itself was modelled and
painted to correspond with the character: a tyrant’s
mask wore a frown, that of a suppliant a distorted look
of misery, and so forth. Increased power was given to
the voice by a large orifice at the mouth. Identity was
indicated wherever possible by some obvious mark:
Apollo was known by his bow, Heracles by his lion’s
skin and club, kings by crowns and sceptres. It was a
joke against Euripides that his heroes so often entered
in the rags of beggary.</p>

<p>Such a cumbersome equipment would be fatal to
acting as we understand it. The mask at once destroys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
all chance of that facial play which we deem essential;
the padded limbs, heavy garments, and gigantic boots
made all life-like motion and <i>élan</i> impossible. This is
no doubt one great reason why the playwrights rarely
exhibit exciting physical action. Even so, the ludicrous
sometimes occurred. Æschines when acting Œnomaus
fell and had to be helped up by the chorus-trainer.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> A
natural supposition is that these impedimenta date not
from Æschylus but from the period of vulgar elaboration.
Certainly, it is not easy to imagine how such
scenes as the delirium of Orestes, or the departure of
Pentheus in the <i>Bacchæ</i>, could have been reasonably
carried out—so to say—on stilts; indeed the whole
spirit of such plays as <i>Orestes</i>, <i>Ion</i>, and <i>Iphigenia at
Aulis</i> seems utterly alien to such equipment. But it is
hard to set aside the voice of all the evidence. The
best way would be to surmise that Euripides sometimes
dispensed with buskins and the rest—though we should
surely expect some allusion to so remarkable a change—for
noble as is the work of his predecessors, it could
be so performed without too absurd an effect. If
Garrick’s audience did not object to his playing Macbeth
in a periwig and knee-breeches, it is likely enough
that Athens was content with such a Clytæmnestra as
Pollux would have us imagine.</p>

<h3>V. <span class="smcap">The Performers and Their Work</span></h3>

<p>A tragic performance was carried out by actors,
extra performers, flute-player, and chorus. All these
were men.</p>

<p>Extra performers, though they take up very little
space in our text, were important to the spectacle.
Mutes were often needed. Not only did these figure
as attendants, crowds, and the like; they are sometimes
important to the plot though they do not happen to
speak. The jury of Areopagites in <i>Eumenides</i> is vital;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
children such as Eurysaces in <i>Ajax</i>, and the sons<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> of
Medea, are important. Other extra performers were
those who had very small speaking or singing parts,
such as Eumelus in <i>Alcestis</i>. This would seem to mean
a fourth actor, but, so slight was the part always<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> allotted,
that it is not an unreasonable statement that there were
never more than three actors. Thirdly, an extra chorus
was occasionally needed for a short scene, as the Propompi
in <i>Eumenides</i> and the Huntsmen in <i>Hippolytus</i>.
Any such extra performer was called a <i>parachoregema</i>
(παραχορήγημα, “extra supply”) and was paid by the
choregus, as the name shows. (The regular chorus
was paid by the State.) At times a chorus sang behind
the scenes and was then called a “parascenion”; this
function would, if possible, be performed by members of
the regular chorus.</p>

<p>Instrumental music was supplied by a single flute-player,
paid by the choregus. He was stationed in the
orchestra, very likely upon the step of the thymele, and
accompanied all songs. At times a harpist was added
to the flute-player; Sophocles had great success with
that instrument in his own <i>Thamyris</i>. At the end of a
play the flute-player led the chorus out of the orchestra.
The music itself is a subject complicated and obscure.
Practically none of it has survived, and the details are
naturally difficult to determine; but some main facts are
clear. Though there was much singing and dancing
the music composed by the tragedians was vastly more
simple than that of a modern opera. All choral singing
was in unison, and as a rule the words dominated the
music.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The result was that an audience followed the
language of an ode with ease, nor is it likely that such
lyrics as those of the <i>Agamemnon</i> or the Colonus-song,
not to mention many others, which are masterpieces of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
literature, would have been written were they fated to
be drowned by elaborate music. Nevertheless a distinct
change took place even in the fifth century, owing
chiefly to the eminent composer Timotheus, whose innovations
were of course looked upon by conservative
taste as corrupt; the comic playwright Pherecrates
grumbles about the way in which his notes scurry hither
and thither like ants in a nest,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> a charge repeated almost
in the same words by Aristophanes against Agathon.
Euripides followed the new manner, and his novelties
are brilliantly caricatured in the <i>Frogs</i>: the elaborate
but thin <i>libretto</i> and the trills.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The increasing use
of monodies, or solos by an actor, which we find in
Euripides—the exotic but effective performance of the
Phrygian slave in <i>Orestes</i> is a conspicuous instance—also
points to the growing importance of musical virtuosity.
Greek music was composed in certain modes
(νόμοι), the precise difference between which is not clear,
though the ethical distinctions are known. The Dorian
mode was austere and majestic, the Lydian and Mixolydian
plaintive, the Phrygian passionate.</p>

<p>We come now to the actors. These three performers
were able to present more than three persons,
since they could change mask and costume behind
the scenes. One of them far outshone the others in
importance—the “protagonist” (πρωταγωνιστής, “first
competitor”). He alone was allotted to the poet by
the archon; the “deuteragonist” and “tritagonist,”
he selected himself; he alone could be a competitor
for the acting prize. The most important rôle was
of course performed by him. In many dramas this
was a vast responsibility; Hamlet himself—the proverbial
instance—is not more vital to his play than
Prometheus, Œdipus, or Medea to theirs. The other
two divided the minor parts among them; it was the
custom to give a tritagonist the rôle of a king when
only spectacularly important—the Doge in <i>The Merchant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of Venice</i> would have been just the part. In
earlier dramas it is plain which rôle would be given
to the protagonist; there is no mistaking the pre-eminence
of Clytæmnestra in <i>Agamemnon</i> or of Philoctetes.
But in some later works it is not clear who is
the outstanding character. In the <i>Bacchæ</i> Dionysus
and Pentheus, in the <i>Orestes</i> Electra and her brother,
have parts of fairly equal importance. In such cases
the protagonist would take an important rôle and a
minor rôle. Change of costume took little time, as
examination of structure sometimes shows.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>This restriction of the “company” to three actors
had important influence upon both plot and presentation.
As for plot, however many persons a dramatist
used, he clearly could not bring more than three of
them forward together. But the power to do even
this was frugally used: there are but few instances
of a genuine three-cornered conversation; one of the
three in turn is generally silent. In the Recognition-scene
of the <i>Tauric Iphigenia</i>, Orestes, Pylades, and
Iphigenia are all present, but though the <i>éclaircissement</i>
fills about two hundred lines, the only part of it in
which all three share is but twenty lines in length.
This frugality indicates that the simplicity of Greek
tragedy is a result not only of external conditions, but
of the poets’ deliberate choice. As for presentation,
the restriction to three actors would result in excellent
playing of minor parts: a thoroughly competent performer
would discharge such short but important rôles
as that of the Butler in <i>Alcestis</i> and the Herald in
<i>Agamemnon</i>. Anyone who has been depressed by
wooden Macduffs and Bassanios will realize the value
of this method.</p>

<p>A Greek actor combined the functions of a modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
actor and of an operatic performer. Lyrics performed
by actor and chorus together were called “commi”
(κομμοί): the most elaborate instance is the great and
lengthy invocation of Agamemnon’s shade in the
<i>Choephorœ</i>. A solo by an actor was known as a
“monody”; Euripides is particularly fond of these;
Ion’s song is perhaps the most attractive. Finally, two
or three actors might sing alternately to each other without
the chorus; no name for this has been preserved.
Certain other passages were neither sung nor spoken,
but delivered in recitative: in tragedy these were the
dialogue-trochaics and anapæsts. Iambics were spoken
(or “declaimed”). Obviously the voice is of great importance
to an actor’s proficiency, above all in a vast
open-air theatre, but Greek writers lay even more stress
upon it than we should have expected. Both volume
and subtlety were demanded. This is illustrated by a
famous story.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> An actor named Hegelochus ruined the
sick-bed scene in <i>Orestes</i> by a slip in pronunciation.
Orestes, on recovering from delirium, says (v. 279):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἐκ κυμάτων γὰρ αὖθις αὖ γαλήν’ ὁρῶ</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“after the billows once more I see a calm”. The unlucky
player instead of saying γαλήν’ said γαλῆν, “once
more do I see a weasel coming out of the waves”. The
theatre burst into laughter, for correct pronunciation was
far more insisted upon than in the English theatre of
to-day.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The status of the acting profession rose steadily
as time went on. At first the poet acted as protagonist,
but this practice was dropped by Sophocles, owing to
the weakness of his voice. From that time acting was
free to develop as a separate profession. In the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of the fifth century a prize for acting was instituted, and
the actor’s name began to be added in the official records
of victories. In the fourth century the importance of the
player increased still more. We have seen that he was
so vital to the success of a playwright that for fairness’
sake the three protagonists each acted in a single
tragedy of each poet. We often hear of brilliant acting
successes. In the fourth century an Actors’ Guild
was formed at Athens and continued in existence for
centuries. Its object was to protect the remarkable
privileges held by the “artists of Dionysus”. They were
looked upon as great servants of religion, and were not
only in high social esteem but possessed definite privileges,
especially the right of safe-conduct through hostile
states and exemption from military service. About the
beginning of the third century before Christ the Amphictyonic
Council, at the instance of the Guild itself,
renewed a decree, the terms of which have fortunately
been preserved,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> affirming the immunity of person and
property granted to the Athenian actors.</p>

<p>The chorus, we have seen, was originally the only
celebrant of the Dionysiac festival. As the importance
of the actors increased it became less and less vital to
the performance. Its numbers, its connexion with the
plot, and the length and relevance of its songs, all steadily
diminished.</p>

<p>Originally there were fifty choristers, but we learn
that early in the fifth century there were only twelve,
and it is suggested that this change was due to the
introduction of tetralogies—the fifty choreutæ being
divided as equally as possible between the four dramas.
Sophocles, it is said, raised the number to fifteen. This
account is doubtful. It is not in the nature of things
likely that Æschylus (if it was he) caused or approved
such an immense drop in numbers, from fifty to twelve:
for the notion that the original chorus was split up into
four is frivolous. Is it not obvious that a poet would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
employ the same choristers for each play of his tetralogy?
Again, that Sophocles should chafe at Æschylus’ twelve
singers and alter the number, and that by a mere trifle
of three, is quite unlikely. There is, moreover, strong
evidence that the elder poet used fifty choreutæ, at any
rate in his earlier time. The <i>Supplices</i> has for chorus
the daughters of Danaus, and their exact number, fifty,
was a familiar <i>datum</i> of the legend. The natural view
is that Æschylus began with fifty, that Sophocles
ended with fifteen, and that between these two points
the number gradually sank. Whether the choreutæ
after the fifth century became still fewer is not clearly
known; there is some evidence that at times they were
only seven.</p>

<p>Next, the dramatic value of the chorus steadily went
down. In our earliest tragedy, the Æschylean <i>Supplices</i>,
the chorus of Danaids is absolutely vital; they are the
chief, almost the sole, interest. In other works of the
same poet their importance is certainly less, but still very
great; everywhere they are deeply interested in the
fate of the chief persons—Xerxes, Eteocles, Prometheus,
Agamemnon, Orestes; the chorus of the <i>Eumenides</i> is
even more closely attached to the plot. In Sophocles a
certain change is to be felt. The connexion between
chorus and plot is of much the same quality as in the
five plays just mentioned, but the emotional tie and
(still more) the tie of self-interest are weaker. The
chorus of Greek seamen in <i>Philoctetes</i> are (in the abstract)
as deeply concerned in the issue as the Oceanids
in <i>Prometheus</i>, but most readers would probably agree
that they show it less; we can “think away” the chorus
more easily from the <i>Philoctetes</i>. In all the other six
Sophoclean dramas the interest of the chorus in the
action is about the same as in the <i>Philoctetes</i>—strong but
scarcely vital. Euripides’ work shows more variety.
<i>Alcestis</i>, <i>Heracleidæ</i>, <i>Hecuba</i>, <i>Ion</i>, <i>Troades</i>, <i>Iphigenia in
Tauris</i>, <i>Helen</i>, and <i>Rhesus</i> all possess choruses which
are <i>prima-facie</i> Sophoclean in this regard, though their
language tends to show less personal concern. In other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
dramas, <i>Medea</i>, <i>Hippolytus</i>, <i>Andromache</i>, <i>Electra</i>, <i>Phœnissæ</i>,
<i>Orestes</i>, <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i>, the chorus is simply a
company of spectators. Thirdly, in two plays, <i>Supplices</i>
and <i>Bacchæ</i>, the importance of the chorus is thoroughly
Æschylean. In Euripides, then, there is found on the
whole a weakening in the dramatic value of the chorus:
in some instances the singers are little more than random
visitors. In the fourth century Aristotle protests
against this: “the chorus too should be regarded as one
of the actors; it should be an integral part of the whole,
and share in the action, in the manner not of Euripides
but of Sophocles”.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>A precisely similar change operated in the length
of the ode. The lyrics of Æschylus’ <i>Supplices</i> form
more than half the work, those of <i>Orestes</i> only one-ninth.
Even at the end of Æschylus’ career we find
in the <i>Agamemnon</i> odes magnificent, elaborate, and
lengthy. Sophocles composed shorter songs which were
still closely germane to the plot. But in Euripides there
frequently occur lyrics whose connexion with the plot is
slight, sometimes difficult to make out. Agathon carried
this still further: his odes are mere interludes, quite outside
the plot.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The fifteen choristers usually entered through the
<i>parodos</i>, marching like soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Drawn up in ranks
upon the orchestra, they followed the action with their
backs to the audience but faced about when they sang.
Their work fell into two parts, the odes sung between
the episodes, and participation in the episodes. The
entrance-song was called the <i>parodos</i> or “entrance,” and
was written in anapæstic rhythm, suitable for marching.
If so, it was chanted in recitative; lyrics were sung.
Songs between episodes were called <i>stasima</i>. This
means “stationary songs,” not because the singers
stood still but because they had taken up their station<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
in the orchestra. As they left at the end they sang
an <i>exodos</i> or “exit” in anapæsts. Besides these, there
were occasional <i>hyporchemes</i> (ὑπορχήματα, “dances”),
short, lively songs expressing sudden joy. All lyrics
were rendered by both song and dance. Singing
was generally executed by all the choreutæ, but some
passages were divided between them. The most frequent
division was into two semi-choruses (ἡμιχόρια),
but now and then individuals sang a few words. Incidental
iambic lines were spoken by one person, and
the short anapæstic system which at the end of the
lyric often announces the approach of an actor was
no doubt assigned to the <i>coryphæus</i>, or chorus-leader
alone. Dancing was also an essential feature, but
both Greeks and Romans meant more by dancing
than do we, or than we did before the rise of “Salome”
performances. It was in fact a mimetic display, giving
by the rhythmic manipulation of all the limbs an
imitation of the emotions expressed, or the events
described, by the song. The whole company, moreover,
went through certain evolutions over the surface
of the orchestra. When they sang the <i>strophe</i><a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> they
moved in one direction, back again for the <i>antistrophe</i>,<a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
and perhaps stood still when there was an <i>epode</i>.<a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> But
nothing is known as to details here. The centre of
all the dancing was the coryphæus (κορυφαῖος, “top
man”), the leader of the chorus; when two semi-choruses
acted separately each had its leader. As was natural,
choric dancing flourished mightily in the early days,
and went down with lyrical performance in general.
Thus Phrynichus congratulated himself on having devised
“as many figures of the dance as are the billows
on the sea under a dread night of storm”. Æschylus
too was a brilliant ballet-master. But Plato, the comic
playwright, at the end of the same century grumbles<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
amusingly:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There was something to watch when the dancing was good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But now there’s no acting to mention—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just a paralysed row of inflexible singers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who howl as they stand at attention.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">During the best period of the chorus its mimetic
dancing must have been a wonderful spectacle. We
hear of highly-skilled performers who could reproduce
action so that the audience followed every detail. They
seem to have “accompanied” some portions of the
episodes in this manner; and that fact may account for
a rather curious feature in the <i>Ion</i>. The messenger
gives a remarkably detailed description of the designs
upon the embroideries wherewith Ion roofed his great
banqueting-marquee—the constellations and “Dawn
pursuing the stars” are all described. Possibly this
was written for the sake of an unusually brilliant mimetic
evolution by groups of choreutæ.</p>

<p>The chorus had other duties during the episodes.
As a body they normally showed themselves interested
spectators; thus the chorus of <i>Orestes</i> enter in order
to inquire of Electra concerning her sick brother. Not
infrequently they do more, taking an actual share in
events. At the close of <i>Agamemnon</i> the Argive elders
are at point to do battle with Ægisthus and his henchmen;
in <i>Alcestis</i> they join the funeral procession; at
other times they aid the persons of the play, not only
by misleading enemies (<i>Choephorœ</i>) or directing friends
(<i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>) but by keeping watch (<i>Orestes</i>).
Further, the coryphæus almost always delivers two or
three lines at the end of every long speech, save when
it ends a scene. These little interpolations are invariably
obvious and feeble. After Hermione’s tirade
against women the coryphæus comments thus: “Too
freely hast thou indulged thy tongue against thy sex.
It is pardonable in thee, but still women should gloss
over the weaknesses of women.” Anyone who has
listened to the delivery of some splendid passage in
Shakespeare, an outburst of Lear or Mercutio’s Queen
Mab speech, will remember how the applause which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
follows it drowns the next speaker’s opening lines.
Some pause is needed. This is provided in Greek
tragedy by the insertion of a line or two which will
not be missed if inaudible.</p>

<p>The satyric chorus diverged little from the tragic in
the points discussed under this section. It had, however,
a special type of dance called the “Sikinnis”. “One
of the postures used ... was called the owl, and is
variously explained by the old grammarians as having
consisted in shading the eyes with the hands, or in turning
the head to and fro like an owl.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">The Audience</span></h3>

<p>The time of the Dionysiac festivals, especially the
great Dionysia, was a holiday for all Athens, and the
centre of enjoyment was the show of tragedies and
comedies. At sunrise the theatre was filled with a huge
throng prepared to sit packed together for hours facing
the sun with no interval for a meal or for exercise. It
is important to remember that in Athens that incalculable
play-goer, “the average man,” did really enjoy and
appreciate first-class dramatic work.</p>

<p>There were a few rows of special seats for officials
and persons otherwise honoured by the State. All the
rest of the space, save for the separation of men and
women, and the possibility that each <i>cercis</i> was allotted
to a distinct tribe, was open to all without distinction
of rank or means. The official seats were in the front
rows, and the first row of all consisted of sixty-seven
marble thrones, most of which are still preserved <i>in situ</i>.
Of these sixty-seven, fifty belonged—as the inscriptions
show—to ecclesiastics, and the famous middle throne—the
best and most conspicuous<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> place in the theatre—was
occupied by the priest of Dionysus of Eleutheræ.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Besides priests, the archons, the generals, and the ten
judges had special places, also benefactors of the State
or their descendants, and the sons of men who had fallen
in battle. Ambassadors from abroad, too, received this
compliment of προεδρία (“foremost seat”).</p>

<p>Behind the dignified front circle of thrones rose tier
after tier of stone benches, all alike and not marked off
into separate seats, so that the audience must usually
have been crowded. They were also cramped, for the
height of each seat was but fifteen inches.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Spectators
brought with them any cushions they needed. Admission
to the theatre was allowed in the first instance
to any Athenian citizen. In spite of the indecency
which was a normal<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> feature of the Old Comedy, there
is no doubt that women and boys were present at
the shows both of tragedy and comedy. Slaves and
foreigners also were admitted, obtaining admission, like
the boys and women, through citizens. Foreigners, except
the distinguished persons to whom <i>proedria</i> was
granted, seem to have been confined to the extreme right
and left <i>cercides</i>, next to the <i>parodoi</i>. All the seating
which has been described dates from the time of the
orator Lycurgus<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> in the fourth century; during the fifth
Athens was content with wooden benches, called <i>icria</i>
(ἴκρια, “planks”).</p>

<p>Admission was at first free, but the drama was so
popular that the rush for seats caused much confusion;
it is said that the more sedulous would secure places the
night before. In the fifth century the custom arose
of charging for admission, and making every one book
in advance, save those dignitaries whose places were
reserved. The price for one day was two obols (about
threepence in weight, but of much greater purchasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
power). At the end of that century this sum was paid
by the State to any citizen who claimed it. The money
allotted for this purpose was called the “theoric” fund
(τὸ θεωρικόν, “money for the shows”), of which we
hear so much in the speeches of Demosthenes. By
his time the system had grown to a serious danger.
Payments were made, not only for the original purpose,
but for all the numerous festivals, and a law was actually
passed that anyone who proposed to apply the fund in
any other way should be put to death. Demosthenes
represents the theoric fund and the Athenian affection
for it as preventing Athens from supplying sufficient
forces to check the growing menace from Philip of
Macedonia. On paying in his two obols the spectator
received a ticket of lead. The sums taken were appropriated
by the lessee or <i>architecton</i> who in consideration
thereof kept the theatre in repair.</p>

<p>As the auditorium was filled with many thousands of
lively Southerners, who had to sit crammed together
from sunrise till late in the day with no intermission,
the question of good order might seem to have been
a hopeless difficulty. It was not so. For, first, the
occasion was religious, and to use blows in the theatre
was a capital crime. Next, stewards (ῥαβδοφόροι,
“rod-bearers”) were at hand to keep order among the
choristers, who were numerous, seeing that each dithyrambic
chorus consisted of fifty men. Finally, a good
deal of exuberant behaviour was allowed. Serious
disturbance occasionally happened: the high-spirited
Alcibiades once had a bout at fisticuffs with a rival
choregus, and the occasion of Demosthenes’ speech
against Meidias was the blow which Meidias dealt the
orator when the latter was choregus.</p>

<p>Though an Athenian audience had no objection,
when comedy was played, to scenes which we should
have supposed likely to strike them as blasphemous,
they bitterly objected to any breach of orthodoxy in
tragic drama. Æschylus once narrowly escaped death
because it was thought that a passage in his play constituted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
a revelation of the mysteries. Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> too,
incurred great trouble owing to the opening lines of
<i>Melanippe the Wise</i>. Approval and dislike were freely
expressed. If the spectators admired a passage, shouts
and clapping showed it: at times they would “encore”
a speech or song with the exclamation αὖθις (“again”).
Still more often do we hear of their proneness to
“damn” a bad play. Hissing<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> was common, and there
was a special custom at Athens of kicking with the heels
upon the benches to express disapproval—a method
which must have been effective in the time of wooden
seats. Playwrights were known to take vigorous means
to win favour. That distinguished writer of New
Comedy, Philemon, is said to have defeated Menander
himself by securing a large attendance of supporters to
applaud his work, and it is certain that writers of the
Old Comedy frequently directed their actors to throw
nuts and similar offerings among the audience. In
the <i>Peace</i> of Aristophanes barley was thus distributed.
The spectators sometimes replied in kind. Bad performers
were pelted with fruit, at any rate in the
country, and even stones were used in extreme cases.
The celebrated Æschines, during his career as a strolling
tritagonist, was nearly stoned to death by his public.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
But the fruit was generally used in the city itself for
another purpose. Aristotle illustrates a detail of psychology
by pointing to the fact that “in the theatre
people who eat dessert do so with most abandon when
the performers are bad”.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="smaller">THE WORKS OF ÆSCHYLUS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The place of Æschylus in dramatic history has
been discussed in the first chapter. We
have still to give some account of his seven
extant plays and of the fragments.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Supplices</span><a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> (Ἱκετίδες, “Suppliant Women”) is
no doubt the earliest of these. The scene is laid near
the sea-coast, not far from Argos. The chorus, consisting
of the fifty daughters of Danaus, enter, and in their
opening song tell how they have fled from Egypt to
escape marriage with their cousins, the fifty sons of
Ægyptus. These suitors have pursued them overseas,
but they call upon Zeus, who through Io is their ancestor,
to defend them. Danaus, their father, urges
them to take refuge upon the steps of the altar.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> This
they do, becoming suppliants of the State-deities and
acquiring a claim upon the citizens. The King of
Argos enters; to him the women make their appeal.
He replies that he must consult the national assembly
before facing the possibility of war with the Egyptians;
meanwhile he sends Danaus into the city to engage
the compassion of the Argives. After another song by
the chorus, in which they relate the wanderings of Io
and her final peace, Danaus returns with the news that
the Argive assembly is unanimous in championing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Suppliants; the women burst forth into lyrical blessings
upon the land. Danaus, who has been upon the watch,
announces the approach of the hostile ships; he comforts
his shrinking daughters, goes to fetch help, and
does not return until the danger is over.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> After a
terrified lyric, the Egyptian herald appears, accompanied
no doubt by warriors; he harshly bids them go to the
ship and submit to their masters. They refuse. He
is on the point of dragging them away when the King
enters, rebukes the herald, and defies the power of
Egypt. The intruder departs with threats of war.
Danaus returns, and with his daughters is given lodging
within the city-walls. The chorus end the drama
with an ode voicing their fear of war and oppression.</p>

<p>Such a close evidently implies that the story was
continued in another work, and it has been conjectured
that the <i>Egyptians</i> and the <i>Danaides</i> (“Daughters of
Danaus”) formed the second and third parts of the
trilogy. Scarcely anything of these two plays has been
preserved, but there is good reason to suppose that the
Egyptians were victorious, that the daughters of Danaus
were compelled to marry their ferocious suitors, and
that on the command of their father each slew her
husband on the wedding-night. Hypermnestra alone
spared her lover, by name Lynceus. It seems that she
was put on her trial for this disobedience and was saved
by the advocacy of Aphrodite, who thus foreshadows the
Apollo of the <i>Eumenides</i>. The satyric play was perhaps
the <i>Amymone</i>; this was the name of one of the
Danaides, who was delivered from a satyr by Poseidon.
Viewed not historically, but æsthetically, especially by
a reader already familiar with the <i>Oresteia</i>, the play
must be confessed bald and monotonous. Many of
Æschylus’ most splendid attributes, it is true, are to be
discerned, but their fire too often sinks into smouldering
grimness. The only really fine passages are
those portions of the lyrics which bear the impress of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the poet’s masculine and profound theology. Such
strictures, however, are merely one way of saying that
the <i>Supplices</i> is an early work. It would be fairer
(were it only possible) to compare it with the drama of
Phrynichus rather than with the <i>Agamemnon</i>. Here,
perhaps for the first time, we have a genuinely dramatic
situation—the collision between the king and the herald.
There is little characterization. The chorus are simply
distressed damsels (save for their vivid and strong religious
faith), the king is simply a magnanimous and
wary monarch, the herald simply a “myrmidon”.
Danaus, however, shows some interesting traits. He
is extremely sententious and rejoices in the fact: “Inscribe
this on your hearts beside the many other precepts
of your father written there”.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> His exhortation<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> to
chaste behaviour, though long and (as his daughters
assure him) unnecessary, is, albeit corrupt textually,
one of the most striking passages in the play. But one
feels that characterization is perhaps less needed in a
work which, literally from the first word, is filled with
the name of God, Zeus,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> the ancestor of the Danaids,
the lord of the universe, the guardian of right. “And
whensoever it is decreed by nod of Zeus that a thing
be brought to fullness, it falls not prostrate, but on its
feet. Yea, through thicket and shadow stretch the
paths of his decrees, that no thoughts can spy them
out.”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Equally majestic is the language concerning
that other Zeus<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> who judges the sins of men in Hades.
Finally, though the thought and diction are in the main
stark if dignified, a change comes over the play before
the end: we get a little “atmosphere”. Danaus
already fears personal enemies (v. 1008), and the arrangements
for lodging the suppliants show a tinge of
domesticity.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Persæ</span><a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> (Πέρσαι, “Men of Persia”), though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
perhaps twenty years later, comes next among the surviving
plays. The action takes place before the palace
of Xerxes. It opens with a song from the chorus, who
represent aged councillors of the Persian Empire. They
describe the departure of the host which is to conquer
Greece, and their own anxiety for news. Atossa,
widow of Darius and mother of Xerxes, enters, distressed
by an ill-omened dream. The councillors discuss
this portent and the prospects of victory. A messenger
arrives who announces the complete overthrow
of the “barbarians”. The queen speedily rallies from
her grief, learns that her son himself is safe, and hears
the narrative of Salamis and the flight of the Persians
back to Asia. She determines to offer supplications to
Heaven and retires to fetch the materials of sacrifice;
the chorus pour forth a lyric lament and deplore the loss
of Darius the conqueror. Atossa returns bearing the
libation which she offers to the shade of Darius, while
the chorus invoke the dead king, praying him to appear
and give counsel. In answer, the ghost of Darius rises
from his tomb. He learns the evil tidings, laments the
impious folly of his son, and foretells the coming disaster
of Platæa. After the shade has sunk back into the
tomb, and Atossa has gone to meet Xerxes,<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> the elders
sing of Persia’s greatness under Darius. Finally, Xerxes
appears, plunged in despair. Amid the antiphonal wailings
of the king and his councillors the tragedy ends.</p>

<p>The scholiast says that “Æschylus won the prize
in the archonship of Menon, with <i>Phineus</i>, <i>Persæ</i>,
<i>Glaucus of Potniæ</i> and <i>Prometheus</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> This tetralogy
seems (to judge from the titles and the fragments) to
have been a collection of plays which had no relation of
subject-matter. Interesting to the historian as the only
extant tragedy dealing with a contemporary subject, the
<i>Persæ</i> also wins the highest admiration as a piece of
literature not unworthy of its theme. The muscular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
and majestic diction of the speeches, the noble sweep
of the lyrics, the colossal dignity of the characters, the
picturesqueness and vigour which make the story of
Salamis one of the greatest passages even in Æschylus—these
are characteristics of the poet which the <i>Supplices</i>
presents only in germ. But the noblest feature
of the whole is the manner in which Æschylus has faced
his chief obstacle. To dramatize the heroic spirit and
overwhelming success of Athens in the presence of
Athenians—was this an easy task? Nothing could be
more cloying at the moment, more thin and unsatisfying
to the after-reflection. Æschylus rises clear above all
this. First, he places the scene not in Athens, but before
the gates of the palace at Susa; that dignity which
elsewhere in Greek tragedy is secured by remoteness in
time, is here obtained by remoteness in space.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The
whole incident is held at arm’s length that it may be
viewed with soberness, and as a whole in perspective.
Next, it has often been observed that on the one hand
he chronicles a host of Asiatic nobles while on the other
not a single Greek—not even Themistocles—is named.
Both these facts spring from the same source. Æschylus,
it cannot be repeated too often, was a deeply religious
man. When he takes it in hand to dramatize an event
of recent history his instinct impels him, just as infallibly
as if he were writing of Heracles or Prometheus, to describe
occurrences not in the language of politics or of
tactics, but of theology. Athens has been but the instrument
of Heaven; Persia has fallen, not through the
brawn of oarsmen or the skill of captains, but through
the blasphemous infatuation of her prince and the wrath
of God following thereupon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">He is little concerned with that play of human psychology
on the Greek side, which forms so brilliant a page of
Herodotus. Even when he narrates that trick by which
the conflict was precipitated, the false message from
Themistocles to Xerxes, nothing is said of the reasons
for sending it. Though the antecedent “facts” are
known, yet he chooses to tell what he does indeed regard
as the truth, that the whole error of the king came from
“a fiend or evil spirit,” and that he fell into the trap because
“he perceived not the guile of the Greek nor <i>the
spite of Heaven</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> On the Greek side, then, “the creatures
of a day” are lost in the vision of eternal righteousness.
But the poet has no such reason to obliterate the
mighty names of Persia. Almost the whole effect of them
is for us lost; but to an Athenian ear these barbaric polysyllables
must have sounded with all the pomp of an
ancient chivalry, the waves of the boundless and terrible
Orient descending in deluge upon the tiny states of
Hellas. But the billows at their highest had been stayed
and had sunk; the appalling roll of warlike titles was
changed into a proclamation of glory—but not the glory
of Greece. No Greek name is immortalized in this play,
which resounds at every moment with the name of God.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seven Against Thebes</span><a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> (Οἱ Ἑπτὰ ἐπὶ Θήβας)
was produced in 467 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and deals with the fratricidal
quarrel of the sons of Œdipus. Eteocles, the elder, had
become King of Thebes and expelled his brother
Polynices. The latter with six comrades-in-arms and an
host led by Adrastus, King of Argos, attacked the city.
The seven invading champions were met at the seven
gates by as many Theban warriors. The scene is laid in
an open space in the town. A messenger brings to Eteocles
the news that the enemy are on the point of assaulting
the walls. The chorus, consisting of Theban maidens,
enter, and in a vivid lyric express their frantic terror.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Eteocles attempts to calm them, urging that their outcries
will demoralize the citizens; but soon they burst
forth again into wild forebodings. Then follows a long
scene in which the messenger describes the seven heroes
who are to attack at the seven gates. As each is described
Eteocles allots one of his comrades for defence.
The seventh enemy is Polynices, the king’s own brother;
Eteocles, spurred on by the curse of his house, declares
that he will himself confront Polynices. He rushes
away and the maidens lament the frightful story of
Œdipus’ curse. The messenger returns with the news
that the invaders have been routed and that the brothers
have fallen by each other’s hand. After the chorus have
lamented this crime, the corpses are brought forward,
accompanied by Antigone and Ismene, sisters of the
dead, who utter an antiphonal dirge. They are interrupted
by a herald who proclaims the decree of the
“people’s councillors”. Eteocles is to be honourably
buried; his brother is to be left to the dogs and birds of
prey. Antigone defies the decree and declares that she
will bury Polynices. The chorus divide into two parties,
one supporting Antigone, the other giving obedience to
the State.</p>

<p>This tragedy won the prize. The trilogy consisted
of <i>Laius</i>, <i>Œdipus</i>, the <i>Seven</i>, with the <i>Sphinx</i> as satyric
play. Aristeas and Polyphradmon, the sons of Pratinas
and Phrynichus respectively, were second and third.
Very little is known about the companion plays.
The <i>Laius</i> contained a reference to the exposure of the
infant Œdipus; the <i>Œdipus</i> described the death of Laius.</p>

<p>The <i>Seven</i> is a magnificently vigorous and graphic
presentment of war in one of its aspects. As such it
is eulogized by Aristophanes, who puts into the mouth
of Æschylus the boast that he “composed a drama full
of the War-God—my <i>Seven against Thebes</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The chief
excellences are the first chorus and the celebrated Choosing
of the Champions. This latter contained the best-known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>

<p class="noindent">As these lines were declaimed in the theatre, Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
tells us, every one turned and gazed at Aristides
the Just. The first half of the play is in strictness not
dramatic<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> at all—a merely static presentment of the
situation: a city in a state of siege, panic among the
women, resolution in the mind of the general. The
later portion gives us decisive action. The King rushes
to his fratricidal duel, spurred on by the invisible curse;
but even here there is no dramatic conflict of personalities
like the altercation between the brothers in the <i>Phœnissæ</i>
of Euripides. Such a collision is, however, provided
at the very end, where Antigone defies the State.</p>

<p>As regards the <span class="smcap">Prometheus Vinctus</span> (Προμηθεὺς
δεσμώτης, “Prometheus Bound”) we are in doubt as
to the date, the arrangement of the cast, and the other
parts of the trilogy.</p>

<p>Concerning the date, we know that the play was
written after 475 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the year in which occurred that
eruption of Etna described by Prometheus (vv. 363-72).
Further, it is usually regarded as later than the <i>Seven</i>
owing to the increased preponderance of dialogue over
lyrics. Also, the supposition that three actors are required
has led some scholars to believe that the <i>Prometheus</i>
belongs to the period when Sophocles had introduced a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
third actor, and so to place it in the last part of the
poet’s life.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The static nature of the drama might seem to
forbid such a view, but possibly it formed the centre of
the trilogy, the most likely place for an equilibrium of
the tragic forces. And the theological basis of the whole
series is so profound, that an approximation in date to
the <i>Oresteia</i> is not unreasonable. On the whole, then,
the <i>Prometheus</i> may be conjecturally assigned to about
the year 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>As for the division of the parts among the actors, we
find in the opening scene three<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> persons engaged, Prometheus,
Hephæstus, and Cratos (“Strength”). Prometheus,
however, does not utter a word until his tormentors
have retired, and it has been held that only two actors are
needed here (as in the rest of the work). On this view,
Prometheus would be represented by a lay-figure, either
Hephæstus or Cratos would return unseen, delivering
the later speeches of Prometheus from behind the figure,
through a mouth-piece in the head. But as there was
no curtain in the theatre, it would be necessary for the
executioners to carry the lay-figure forth in view of the
audience before the action began. The true objection
to this is not its absurdity; an audience will tolerate
much awkwardness in stage-management, if only it is
accustomed to such conventions. But it would scarcely
have harmed the play if the poet had dispensed with
Cratos; the actor thus disengaged could have impersonated
Prometheus from the beginning. That
Æschylus saw this possibility cannot be doubted; therefore
he did not feel bound to use a lay-figure; therefore
he did not, and we must assume that he employed three
actors.</p>

<p>Two other tragedies were associated with this,
<i>Prometheus the Fire-bringer</i> (Προμηθεὺς πυρφόρος) and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
<i>Prometheus Unbound</i> (Προμηθεὺς λυόμενος). That the
latter followed the extant play is of course certain, but
the position of the <i>Fire-bringer</i> is doubtful. One
would naturally place it first in the trilogy: the offence,
the punishment, the reconciliation. But, say some, in
that case one can hardly imagine how Æschylus wrote
the first tragedy without anticipating a great part of the
second—the noble account which Prometheus gives of
the victory of Zeus, his own offence, and the blessings
it conferred upon men. Hence arises a theory that the
<i>Fire-bringer</i> was the last play of the trilogy in which
the Titan, reconciled to Zeus, became a local deity of
Athens, the giver of fire. But this view has been discredited
by evidence<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> that there is not enough matter
remaining for the <i>Fire-bringer</i> after the close of the
<i>Prometheus Unbound</i>. These two difficulties about the
position of the <i>Fire-bringer</i> have induced some to
identify it with that <i>Prometheus</i> which we know as the
satyric play appended to the <i>Persæ</i> trilogy, and to
suppose that Æschylus told the story in two plays only,
the present trilogy being completed by a tragedy unconnected
with the subject. The best view is that the
<i>Fire-bringer</i> was the first play; the title suggests that it
dealt with the transgression which led to the punishment
portrayed in the extant drama; and the objection
as to overlapping of the <i>Fire-bringer</i> and the <i>Prometheus
Vinctus</i> is illusory.</p>

<p>The scene is a desolate gorge in Scythia. Hephæstus,
the God of Fire, with Cratos and Bia, Strength and
Violence, servants of Zeus, appear, dragging with them
the Titan Prometheus. Hephæstus nails the prisoner
to the rocks under the superintendence of Cratos; he
has little liking for his task, but Cratos rebukes his
tenderness for the malefactor who has braved Heaven
in order to succour mankind. At length Prometheus is
left to his lonely agony. Hitherto he has been silent,
but now he voices his pain and indignation to the sea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
and sky and earth around him. His soliloquy breaks
off as he catches the sound of wings, and the chorus
enter—a band of sea-nymphs who have been startled
from their cave by the clatter of iron. They strive to
comfort him, and he tells how by his counsel Zeus was
enabled to defeat the Titans. Then, consolidating his
empire, the god determined to destroy mankind and
create a new race. Prometheus, in love of men, saved
them from destruction and bestowed upon them the
gift of fire, which he stole from Heaven and which
has been the beginning of civilization. At this point
Oceanus enters, riding upon a four-legged bird; he is a
Titan who stood aloof from the conflict with Zeus. An
amiable but obsolete person, he wishes to release
Prometheus (without running into danger himself) and
urges submission. The prisoner listens with disdainful
courtesy, refuses the advice, and hints to Oceanus that
he had better not associate with a malefactor. His
visitor soon bustles away, and the chorus sing how all
the nations of the earth mourn over the torments of
their deliverer. Prometheus then tells of the arts by
which he has taught man to alleviate his misery. The
Nymphs ask if he has no hope of release himself; he
hints at the possible downfall of Zeus. Another lyrical
passage hymns the power of that god and expresses
surprise at the contumacy of the Titan. Then appears
Io, the heifer-maiden, who at the request of the chorus
describes her strange ill-fortune. Beloved of Zeus, she
has incurred the wrath of his queen, Hera, who has
changed her into a heifer and sent her roaming wildly
over the earth pursued by a gadfly. Prometheus prophesies
her future wanderings, which shall end in Egypt.
He speaks more clearly of the fall of Zeus, who is preparing
to wed one who shall bear a child greater than
his father. Then he narrates the story of Io’s course
up to the present hour, ending with the prophecy
that in Egypt she shall bear to Zeus a son named
Epaphus. He speaks of the history of this man’s line,
particularly of one “courageous, famed for archery” who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
shall release Prometheus. Io, in a sudden paroxysm,
rushes from the scene. The chorus sing of the dangers
which lie in union with the Gods. Prometheus again
foretells the overthrow of Zeus by his own son. Hermes,
the messenger of Zeus, enters demanding that the
prisoner reveal the fatal secret. Prometheus treats his
message with defiance. Hermes warns him of still
more fell tortures: the “winged hound of Zeus” will
come each day to tear his liver; a convulsion of the earth
will hurl him into Hades. The nymphs again urge submission,
but when the messenger declares that unless
they leave Prometheus they will perchance suffer too,
they haughtily refuse to listen. Amid an upheaval of
the whole of Nature, the Titan, still defiant, sinks from
sight.</p>

<p>The <i>Prometheus Vinctus</i> has impressed all generations
of readers with wonder and delight; in particular
it has inspired poetry only less magnificent than itself.
Shelley’s <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> is a gorgeous amplification
of its spiritual and material features. The sinister
and terrific figure which dominates the early part of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> is but Prometheus strayed at an untoward
hour into Christian mythology. Again, this play is the
noblest surviving example of the purely Æschylean
manner. The <i>Oresteia</i> is greater, perhaps, certainly
more interesting to us; but there Æschylus has reacted
to the spirit of Sophocles. Here, the stark hauteur
of the <i>Supplices</i> has developed into a desolate
magnificence. The lyrics which, since the <i>Seven</i>, have
again dwindled in size, have yet grown in beauty, variety,
and characterization. On the other side, there is a
development of the dialogue which is amazing. Long
speeches are still the rule, but line-by-line conversations
are frequent. Characters in the <i>Supplices</i> and the <i>Seven</i>
talk as if blank-verse dialogue were a strange and
difficult art—as indeed it was till Æschylus forged it
into shape. Throughout, whether in lengthy speeches
or in conversation, the iambic metre has found a grace
and suppleness which is too often ignored by those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
who come to the <i>Prometheus</i> fresh from the <i>Medea</i> or
the <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>. Above all, the maturity of
Æschylus’ poetic strength is to be seen in the terrific
perspectives which he brings before us—perspectives
of time, as the voice of the tortured prophet carries
us down a vista of centuries through the whole history
of Io’s race to the man of destiny; perspectives of
scenery, as the eye of the Ocean-Nymphs from the
summit of earth gazes down upon the tribes of men,
horde behind horde fading into the distance, all raising
lament for the sorrows of their saviour; perspectives of
thought, as the exultant history of civilization leaps from
the lips of him who dies hourly through untold years to
found and uphold it, telling how that creeping victim of
his own helplessness and the disdain of Heaven goes
from weakness to strength and from strength to
triumph.</p>

<p>No less wonderful is the strictly dramatic economy
of the play. The action is slight. Prometheus works
no more; it is his part to endure. All the secondary
characters act as a foil to bring the central figure into
massive relief. Each has some touch of Prometheus:
Hephæstus, pity without self-sacrifice; Cratos, strength
without reflection; the Nymphs, tenderness without
force; Oceanus, common-sense without dignity; Io,
sensibility to suffering without the vision which learns
the lesson of pain; Hermes, the power to serve without
perception of the secret of sovereignty. Most essential
of all these is Io. The only human participant in the
action, she reminds us that the hand of Zeus has been
heavy upon innocent mortals as well as rebel gods, and
thus gives fresh justification to the wrath of Prometheus.
Still more, she is vital to the whole trilogy. As
Hephæstus links the <i>Fire-bringer</i> to the second play, so
does she join the second play to the <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>.
It is her descendant Heracles who after thirteen
generations will free Prometheus and reconcile him to
Zeus; the hero of the last drama is brought in a sense
upon the scene in the person of his ancestress. Prometheus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
himself suggests to us the thought of Christ; and
yet (as has been said) the Satan of Milton is like him
too. This double kinship is made possible by the conception
of Zeus which here obtains. Under the sceptre
of a god who hates mankind it is possible for the saviour
of men to be a rebel and an outcast. Right or wrong,
the Titan is godlike in his goodness, his wisdom, his
courage. At one point only does his deity show a flaw;
he endures his pangs not as a god, but as a man; he
agonizes, he laments his pains, he utters exclamations of
fear. Rightly, for if the actors in this world-drama are
immortal, the spectators are not. To have portrayed
Prometheus as facing his punishment without a quiver
would have been perhaps sounder theology, but worse
drama; the human audience must be made to understand
something at least of these pangs, or the greatness
of the sacrifice will elude them. A parallel on which
we must not dilate cannot escape the reader. One
strange outcome of his rebellion is generally overlooked.
Zeus had wished to destroy mankind and create a new
race. That is, he meant to treat men as he treated the
Titans—or would have treated them had they been
mortal. Prometheus thwarted this plan, so that we
men are a survival of that pre-moral world which the
new ruler supersedes. We are the younger brothers of
the Titans and (so to put it) have all survived the Flood.
Our pettiness and futility condemned us in the eyes of
Zeus, who wished for progress; but Prometheus loved
us in spite of our miserable failings, and so insisted on
carrying us over into the new and nobler world at the
cost of his own age-long agony.</p>

<p>The basic question must be briefly discussed—the
relation of Prometheus to the new King of Heaven.
Zeus is here described as a youthful tyrant, blind to
all rights and interests save the security of his recent
conquest. This cannot have been the picture presented
by the whole trilogy. Not only is enough known of
Æschylus’ religious views to make such a theory impossible;
though the <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> is lost we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
know the story in outline. Heracles in his wanderings
came upon Prometheus, now released from Hades,
but still chained to his rock and gnawed by the vulture.
The hero slew the bird with an arrow, and procured
the release of Prometheus by inducing the wounded
Centaur Chiron to go down to death in his place, and
by reconciling the Titan to Zeus, who promised to
free him on hearing the secret of the fatal marriage.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Prometheus, to commemorate his captivity, assumed
a ring of iron. The authority of the King of Gods
was thus for ever established. It is only in a different
atmosphere that any inconsistency can be felt. For
Æschylus there was a progress in the history of Heaven
as in the civilization of earth. Even Zeus in the early
days of his dominion seeks to rule by might divorced
from wisdom, a severance typified by his feud with
Prometheus. He has his lesson to learn like all others;
if he will not govern with the help of law, bowing
to Fate, then the hope of the Universe is vain and
the blind forces of unguided Nature, the half-quelled
Titans, will bring chaos back. But youthful and
harsh as he is, his will has a moral foundation, unlike
theirs; and so perhaps it is that Prometheus cannot
but exclaim “I sinned” in opposing that will. Upon
the reconciliation between Zeus and his antagonist,
Prometheus became a local Attic deity and no more.
That eternal wisdom which he embodied is mysteriously
assimilated into the soul of Zeus. This is the
consummation; omnipotence and omniscience are at
one.</p>

<p>We arrive finally at the trilogy which bears the
name <span class="smcap">Oresteia</span> and which obtained the prize in 458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
This is the only instance in which the whole series
has survived; the satyric play, <i>Proteus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> has perished.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
The name <i>Oresteia</i> was applied to the whole tetralogy.</p>

<p>The background of the <span class="smcap">Agamemnon</span><a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> is the palace
of King Agamemnon at Argos. A sentinel is discovered
upon the roof; he is watching for the beacon
which shall signify that Troy has at length fallen.
While waiting he broods, dropping hints that all is
not well at home. Then the beacon flashes forth,
and he shouts the news to the Queen Clytæmnestra
within the house. On his departure the chorus enter,
aged councillors of Argos, who have not yet heard
the tidings. They sing of the quarrel between Greece
and Troy and describe the sacrifice of Iphigenia,
Agamemnon’s daughter, who was offered up to Artemis
in order to obtain a favourable wind for the fleet. All
the altars are blazing with incense; Clytæmnestra
enters, and they ask her the reason. Troy, she replies,
was taken last night; a system of beacons has been
arranged; the signal has spread over sea and land
before dawn. She ponders over the state of the captured
city and hopes that the victors have not sinned
against the gods of Troy. The old men sing praise
to Heaven and moralize on the downfall of human
pride. A herald appears, announcing that Agamemnon
has landed and will soon reach the city; he dilates
on the miseries of the campaign, till the queen sends
him away with her welcome to Agamemnon. The
chorus call him back and ask news of Menelaus, the
king’s brother; Menelaus, he replies, is missing: as
the Greeks were sailing home a tempest arose which
scattered the fleet. Agamemnon’s ship has returned
alone. The elders, after he has gone, sing of Helen
and the deadly power of her beauty. Agamemnon
arrives, accompanied by the daughter of the Trojan
King Priam, Cassandra the prophetess, who has become
his unwilling concubine. Clytæmnestra greets
him with effusiveness, to which he responds haughtily.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
She persuades him against his will to walk into the
palace over rich carpets like an Oriental conqueror,
and accompanies him within doors. The chorus express
forebodings which they cannot understand. The
queen comes forth and orders Cassandra within, to
be present at the sacrifice of thanksgiving, but the
captive pays no heed and Clytæmnestra in anger
retires. The elders attempt to encourage the silent girl,
who at last breaks forth into incoherent cries, not of
fear but of horror, and utters vague but frightful prophecies
of bloodshed and sin, punctuated by the bewildered
questions of her hearers. She tells them that
they will see the death of Agamemnon, bewails her own
wretchedness, greets her death, and prophesies the
coming of an avenger. She passes into the house.
After a lyric on wicked prosperity, the voice of the
king is heard crying within that he has been mortally
wounded. Another shriek follows, and then silence.
The chorus are in a tumult, when the doors are flung
open and Clytæmnestra is seen standing over the
corpses of Agamemnon and Cassandra. She has
slain the king with an axe, entrapping him in the
folds of a robe while in his bath. In reply to the furious
accusations of the elders she glories in her act—she
is the personification of the ancestral curse; and she
has avenged the murder of Iphigenia. The altercation
has for the moment reached something like calm, when
Ægisthus appears. He is the cousin of Agamemnon,
but between the two families there is a murderous and
adulterous feud; Ægisthus himself is the lover of
Clytæmnestra and has shared in the plot. The Argives
turn on him in hatred and contempt, which he answers
with tyrannical threats. They remind him that Orestes,
the king’s young son, is alive and safe abroad. Swords
are drawn, but Clytæmnestra insists that the quarrel
shall cease; she and Ægisthus must rule with dignity.</p>

<p>A novel theory of the plot has been put forward
by the late Dr. A. W. Verrall in his edition of the play.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
He finds the following difficulties in the usual acceptation:
(i) Agamemnon lands in Argos on the morning
after the night in which Troy was captured, though
as a matter of course and a matter of “history” several
days (at the very least) must have elapsed before the
Greek host so much as embarked; and though a storm
has befallen the fleet on its way. (ii) The story given
by Clytæmnestra about the beacons is absurd. Why
has the arrangement existed for only one year of the
ten? Why make an arrangement which would depend
so entirely on the weather? How could the beacon
on Mount Athos have been seen from Eubœa (a hundred
miles away) when a tempest was raging on the
intervening sea? (iii) This mystery, that Agamemnon
reaches home only two or three hours after his signal,
is never cleared up: neither he nor the queen mentions
it when they meet. (iv) Thus the whole affair of
the beacons is gratuitous as well as incredible. (v)
We are not told how Agamemnon was slain. That
is, though the poet is precise enough about the details
of the actual murder, we are not enlightened as to how
a great and victorious prince could be killed with impunity
by his wife and her lover, who thereupon, with
no difficulty, usurp the government. (vi) What does
Ægisthus mean by claiming to have contrived the
whole plot? On the face of it he has done nothing
but skulk in the background. Dr. Verrall’s explanation,
set forth with splendid lucidity, skill, and brilliance,
may be briefly summarized thus. For a year Clytæmnestra
and Ægisthus have been joined in a treasonable
and adulterous league, Ægisthus knows what is happening
at Troy and has the first news of Agamemnon’s
landing (at night). He lights upon Mount Arachnæus
a beacon which tells Clytæmnestra that all is ready.
(Her story of the fire-chain is a lie to deceive the
watchman and the elders.) Agamemnon thus naturally
arrives only an hour or two after the news that Troy
has fallen. The assassination-plot succeeds for various
reasons. During the ten years’ war many citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Argos have been alienated from the king by the enormous
loss of Greek lives. Hence the usurpers have
a strong body of potential adherents. In fact, several
passages which our texts attribute to the chorus
really belong to conspirators. Next, Agamemnon by
the accident of the storm has with him, not the great
host, but a single ship’s company. Finally, though
he has heard much ill of his wife—this only can account
for the brutality wherewith he greets her—he does not
suspect her resourcefulness, wickedness, and courage.
Verrall’s theory should probably be accepted.</p>

<p>This tragedy is beyond compare the greatest work
of Æschylus. The lyrics surpass those of any other
drama. To the majesty and scope familiar everywhere
in Æschylean choric writing, and to the tenderness which
diffuses a gentle gleam through the <i>Prometheus</i>, are
now added matchless pathos and the authentic thrill
of drama. The picture of Iphigenia (vv. 184-249) is
not merely lovely and tearful beyond words; it is a
marvel that this gloomy colossus of the stage should
for a moment have excelled Euripides on Euripides’
strongest ground; it is as if Michelangelo had painted
Raffaelle’s “Madonna of the Grand Duke” amid the
prophets and sibyls of the Sistine Chapel. Even more
poignant, because more simple, are the brief lines (vv.
436-47) which tell how the War-God, the money-changer
of men’s bodies, sends back from Troy a
handful of charred dust, the pitiful return for a man
who has departed into the market-place of Death.
Best known of all perhaps is the passage (vv. 402-26)
which portrays the numb anguish of a deserted husband.
Further, these lyrics are dramatic. The choric songs
do not suspend the action by their sublime elucidations;
the comments enable us to understand the march of
events, giving us the keynote of the scene which follows
each lyric. For instance, when the first stasimon
dilates, not upon the glory of conquest, but upon the
fall of pride and the sorrows of war, we are prepared
for the herald and his tale in which triumph is overborne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
by the memory of hardship and tempest. The
misgivings which brood over the third stasimon, in
spite of the victorious entry of the king which has
just been witnessed, is a fit prelude to the terrible
outbreaks of Cassandra.</p>

<p>The characterization shows a marked advance on
the <i>Prometheus</i> in variety and colour. This is not so
much because three actors are needed as against two in
the earlier play; for though they are necessary, comparatively
little use is made of the increased facilities. But,
while Clytæmnestra is technically as great a creation
as Prometheus, the secondary persons are much more
interesting in themselves than in the earlier drama.
They do of course form a series of admirable foils to the
queen, but they are worthy of careful study for their own
sakes, which cannot be said very heartily for the lesser
personages of the <i>Prometheus</i>. The sentinel is excellent,
sketched in a few lines with a sureness of touch which
is a new thing in this poet’s minor characters. The
sense of impending trouble mixed with expected joy, the
flavour of rich colloquialism about his speech, and the
hearty dance upon the palace-roof wherewith he hails
the beacon, make him live. Even more commonplace,
theoretically, is the part given to the herald, but him
again Æschylus has created a real man. The passionate
joy with which he greets his native soil, and the
lugubrious relish wherewith he details the hardships of
the army before Troy, make him our friend at once, and
present us with that sense of atmosphere which is often
lacking in Greek tragedy. Agamemnon may seem a disappointing
figure; very naturally, for it is the poet’s
purpose to disappoint us. To depict a great and noble
king would have spoiled the splendid effect of Clytæmnestra.
Agamemnon’s murder must be made for the
moment as intelligible as may be, therefore the dramatist
shows us a conceited, heavy-witted, pompous person who
none the less reveals certain qualities which have made
it possible for such a man to overthrow Troy.</p>

<p>Clytæmnestra is Æschylus’ masterpiece—not indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
a masterly picture of female character; such work was
left to others—but a superb presentment of a woman
dowered with an imperial soul, pressed into sin by the
memory of her murdered child, the blind ambition of her
husband, and the consciousness of an accursed ancestry.
Here, as elsewhere in these three tragedies, the architectural
skill with which Æschylus plans his trilogy invite
the closest study. In this first part, all the justification
which Clytæmnestra can claim is held steadily before the
eyes. The slaughter of Iphigenia, which killed her love
for Agamemnon, is dwelt upon early in the play and
recalled by her once and again during her horrible
conversation with the chorus after the king’s death.
Another wrong to her is brought visibly upon the scene
in the person of Cassandra. The sordid side of her
vengeance, her amour with Ægisthus, remains hardly
hinted at until the very end, where it springs into overwhelming
prominence—but at the very moment when
we are preparing to pass over to the <i>Choephorœ</i>, the
second great stage of the action, in which the mission of
Orestes is to be exalted. Clytæmnestra has been often
compared to Lady Macbeth. But Shakespeare’s creation
is more feminine than that of the Athenian. She
evinces inhuman heartlessness and cynicism till the task
is accomplished; before the play ends she is broken for
ever. Clytæmnestra never falters in her resolution,
hardly a quiver reveals the strain of danger and excitement
upon her nerves while success is still unsure. When
the deed is accomplished and the strain relaxed, then,
instead of yielding to hysterical collapse, she is superbly
collected.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Years after, she re-appears in the <i>Choephorœ</i>,
but time, security, and power have, to all seeming, left
little mark upon this soul of iron. At the last frightful
moment when she realizes that vengeance is knocking
at the gate, her courage blazes up more gloriously than
ever: “Give me the axe, this instant, wherewith that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
man was slain”.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> It is a superb defiance; for thrilling
audacity this passage stands perhaps alone until we come
to the splendid “Stand neuter, Gods, this once, I do invoke
you,” with which Vanbrugh<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> rises, for his moment,
into the heights where Æschylus abode. Yet next
moment the knowledge that her lover is dead brings her
to her knees.</p>

<p>Cassandra and Ægisthus have not yet been considered,
for they belong also to the next topic—the
method in which the unity of the play is so handled that
it does not interfere with, but helps to effect, the unity
of the whole trilogy. The indescribable power and
thrill of Cassandra’s scene may easily blind us to the
slightness of the character-drawing. Simply as a character,
the princess is no more subtly or carefully studied
than the herald; the extraordinary interest which surrounds
her arises not from what she is or does but from
what happens to her. She is the analogue of Io in the
<i>Prometheus</i>. The mere structure of both plays allots to
Io and Cassandra precisely the same functions. Passive
victims of misfortune, they are the symbol and articulation
of the background in the particular drama; further,
they are vital to the economy of the whole series, in that
they sum up in themselves the future happenings which
the later portions of it are to expound. So far, they are
the same; but when we go beyond theoretical structure
and look to the finished composition, Cassandra far outshines
Io. The Argive maiden suffers, shrinks, and
laments in utter perplexity. The Trojan suffers, but she
does not quail; her lamentations are hardly lamentations
at all, so charged are they with lofty indignation, and
the sense of pathos in human things. Io is broken by
her calamity; Cassandra is purified and schooled. The
poet who in this very play sings that suffering is the path
to wisdom has not made us wait long for an example.
There is, too, a definite technical advance in this, that
Io merely hears the prophecy of justification and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
possibility of revenge, while Cassandra in her own person
foretells the return of Orestes.</p>

<p>Ægisthus also, but less obviously, is important to the
progress of the trilogy. His appearance and his speeches
are no anti-climax to the splendid scene of Clytæmnestra’s
triumph. The queen and Cassandra have talked
of the Pelopid curse; Ægisthus is the curse personified.
It is through ancient wickedness that he has passed a
half-savage life of brooding exile; the sins of his fathers
have turned him into a man fit to better their instruction.
Again, this last scene brings before us in full power that
aspect of Clytæmnestra which has been almost ignored—her
baser reason for the murder of her husband. This
is done precisely at the right place. To dwell on the
queen’s intrigue earlier would have deprived her of that
measure of sympathy which throughout this first play she
needs. Not to have depicted it at all would have left that
sympathy unimpaired, and we should have entered upon
the <i>Choephorœ</i> fatally unable to side with Orestes in his
horrible mission.</p>

<p>The story of the <span class="smcap">Choephorœ</span><a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> (Χοηφόροι, “Libation-Bearers”)
is as follows. The back-scene throughout
probably represents the palace of Argos; in the orchestra<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
is the tomb of Agamemnon. Something like
ten years have elapsed since the usurpation of Ægisthus.
Orestes, son of the murdered king, accompanied by his
friend Pylades, enters and greets his father’s grave, laying
thereon a lock of his hair in sign of mourning; they
withdraw. The chorus (led by Electra) enter—attendants
of Electra carrying libations, to be poured in prayer
upon Agamemnon’s tomb. Their song expresses their
grief, hints at revenge, and explains that they have
been sent by Clytæmnestra herself, who is terrified by a
dream interpreted to signify the wrath of Agamemnon’s
spirit. Electra discusses the situation with her friends,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
and pours the libations over the mound in her own
name, not on behalf of her mother, calling upon the
gods and Agamemnon’s spirit to bring Orestes home
and punish the murderess. Electra discovers the tress
of hair left by Orestes. That it has come from him she
knows, as it resembles her own;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> he must have sent it.
In the midst of her excitement, she perceives footprints;
these, too, she recognizes as like her own. Suddenly
Orestes appears and reveals himself. She still doubts,
but he exhibits a piece of embroidery which she herself
worked long ago. Electra falls into his arms; Orestes
explains to his friends that Apollo has sent him home
as an avenger. In a long lyrical scene (κομμός), the
chorus, Electra, and Orestes invoke Agamemnon to
assume life and activity in aid of his avenger.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The
chorus leader tells Orestes of Clytæmnestra’s vision.
She dreamed that she gave birth to a snake, which
drew blood from her breast. He expounds this as foretelling
the death of the queen at his hands. Explaining
that he and his followers will gain admission to the
palace as travellers, he departs. The maidens raise a
song of astonishment at the crimes of which mortals are
capable, dwelling especially upon the treachery of an
evil woman. Orestes comes back accompanied by his
followers, and tells the porter that he brings news for
the head of the house. Clytæmnestra appears, and receives
the feigned message that Orestes is dead. The
queen is apparently overwhelmed, but bids the visitors
become her guests. While the chorus utter a brief
prayer for success, the aged nurse of Orestes comes
forth, in grief for the loss of her foster-son. She tells
the chorus she has been despatched by Clytæmnestra
to summon Ægisthus and his bodyguard, that he may
question the strangers. They persuade her to alter the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
message; let Ægisthus come unattended. When she
has gone, they raise another lyric in passionate encouragement
of Orestes. Ægisthus enters and goes into
the guest-wing of the house; in a moment his scream
is heard; the chorus retire.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> A servant of Ægisthus
bursts forth, proclaiming the death of his master. He
flings himself upon the main door, desperately shouting
for Clytæmnestra, who in a moment appears. His
message, “The dead are slaying them that live,” is
clear to her: doom is at hand, but she calls for her
murderous axe. Orestes rushes out upon her with
drawn sword. His first words announce the death of
Ægisthus, and she beseeches him piteously for mercy.
Orestes, unnerved, asks the counsel of Pylades, who for
the first and last time speaks, reminding the prince of
his oath and the command of Heaven. Clytæmnestra
is driven within to be slain beside her lover. After a
song of triumph from the chorus, the two corpses are
displayed to the people; beside them stands Orestes
who brings forth the blood-stained robe wherein
Agamemnon was entangled. The sight of it brings
upon the speaker a perturbation strange even in such
circumstances. It is the coming of madness. He sees
in fancy the Furies sent by his mother’s spirit, and
rushes away to seek at Delphi the protection which
Apollo has promised. The play ends with a few lines
from the chorus lamenting the sinful history of the
house.</p>

<p>The <i>Choephorœ</i> is less popular with modern readers
than either of its companions. This is owing partly to
the difficulty of perusal, for the text of the lyrics is often
corrupt; it is still more due to no accident, but to
technique. The second play of a trilogy was usually
more statuesque than the other two. There is, of course,
a progress of events, not merely a Phrynichean treatment
of a static theme; but the poet carefully retards
his speed. Thus the <i>Choephorœ</i> should be compared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
rather with the <i>Prometheus</i> than with the <i>Agamemnon</i>.
We then observe an improvement—if we wish to call it
so—in construction. The great Commos keeps the play
almost<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> at a standstill; but the rest of the work is full
of dramatic vigour.</p>

<p>It is true that none of the characters has the arresting
quality of those in the <i>Agamemnon</i>. The nurse is
a worthy companion to the watchman—her quaint and
explicit references to the trouble caused her by Orestes
when a baby are the most remarkable among the few
comic touches found in our poet; and the part of the
slave who gives the alarm, minute indeed, is yet the
finest of its kind in Greek tragedy. But the persons of
greater import—Electra, Ægisthus, and Pylades—would
not have taxed the skill of a moderate playwright.
Clytæmnestra is magnificent, but less through her
present part than through the superb continuation of
her rôle in the <i>Agamemnon</i>; her scenes are brief, like
the glimpse of a fierce sunset after a lowering day.
She is the only person characterized, except, indeed,
Orestes, and even he through most of the drama is not
a character, but a purpose and a few emotions speaking
appropriate sentences. This is true even of the scene
where he condemns his mother. The only touch of
genuine drama is the instant where he quails before her
entreaty; but though this is real enough, it is not great.
The undoubted power of the scene is due not to
dramatic skill, but to the intrinsic horror of the situation,
Æschylus has given us almost as little as we could
expect. But turn the page and study Orestes’ address
to the Argive state—the increase in dramatic force is
appalling. He begins by stately, vigorous, and impassioned
eloquence equal to almost anything in the
<i>Agamemnon</i>. The blood-stained robe is displayed, and
the hideous sight seems to eat into his brain. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
grip on what he means to say slips; he struggles to recapture
it; one can see his failing mind stagger from
the mother of whom he strives to speak to the garment
of death before him. A word rises to the surface of his
thoughts, he snatches at it, but it brings up with it the
wrong phrase. The horror passes into us; this half-madness
is not lunatic incoherence but the morbidly
subtle coherence of a masterful mind struggling against
insanity. The deadly net entangles his brain as it entangled
his fathers body. By a final effort he collects
himself and declares that he goes to Delphi to claim
the protection and countenance of Heaven. Then his
doom settles upon him; the Furies arise before him and
he flees distraught.</p>

<p>That such immense force should be manifested only
at the end of the play, that until and during the crisis
Æschylus exerts only sufficient dramatic energy to present
his situations intelligibly, is the most significant
fact in the <i>Choephorœ</i>. This is deliberate in an artist
who has composed the <i>Agamemnon</i> and the <i>Eumenides</i>.
In the opening stage it is human sin and courage which
provide the rising interest; in the third the righteousness
and wisdom of the Most High unloose the knot and
save mankind; at both periods personality is the basis
of action. But in the middle stage the master is not
personality, but the impersonal Fury demanding blood
in vengeance for blood, a law of life and of the universe,
named by a name but possessing no attributes. This
law may be called by a feminine title Erinys; it is called
also by a phrase: “Do and Suffer”;<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> it is the shade of
Agamemnon, thirsting—is it for blood as a bodily drink
or for death as expiation?—and sending the dark progeny
of his soul up from Hades. This fact, then, and
no person, it is which dominates the play, and that is
why the persons concerned are for the time no magnificent
figures of will or valour or wisdom, but the panting
driven thralls of something unseen which directs their
movements and decides their immediate destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>The plot of the third play, the <span class="smcap">Eumenides</span><a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> (Εὐμενίδες,
“the Kindly Ones,” an euphemistic name of the
Furies) is as follows. Outside the shrine at Delphi, the
Pythian priestess utters a prayer to all the deities connected
with the spot, after which she enters the sanctuary.
Almost instantly she returns in horror, and tells how she
has seen a blood-stained man seated upon the <i>Omphalos</i>
and round him a band of sleeping females, loathly to the
sight. She departs. From the temple the god appears<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
with his suppliant Orestes, whom he encourages and
sends forth (led by the god Hermes) on his wanderings,
which are to end in peace at Athens. When the two
have disappeared, the ghost of Clytæmnestra rises and
awakens the sleeping Furies. They burst forth from
the temple in frenzy at the escape of their victim. In
the midst of the clamour Apollo, with words of contemptuous
hatred, bids them begone. The scene now changes
to Athens, where Orestes throws himself upon the protection
of the goddess Athena, whose statue he clasps.
In a moment the chorus of Furies enter in pursuit; they
discover Orestes and describe the horrible doom which
he must suffer. He defies them and calls upon the
absent Athena. But they circle about him chanting
their fearful “binding-song”—the proclamation of their
office and rights as the implacable avengers of bloodshed
and every other sin. As their strains die away Athena
enters. She hears the dispute in outline, the Furies insisting
that for matricide there can be no pardon, Orestes
declaring that he has been purified ritually by Apollo
who urged him to his deed. The goddess determines
that the suit shall be tried by a court of her own citizens.
Meanwhile the Furies sing of the danger to righteousness
which must result if their prerogatives are withdrawn:
“terror <i>has</i> a rightful place and must sit for ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
watching over the soul”.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The court of justice is now
assembled on the Areopagus. Athena presides; with
her are the jurymen (generally supposed to number
twelve); before her are the Furies and Orestes; behind
is a great crowd of Athenian citizens. A trumpet blast
announces the opening of the session, and Apollo enters
to aid Orestes. The trial begins with a cross-examination
of Orestes by the Furies, in which he is by no
means triumphant. Apollo takes his place and gives
justification for the matricide, under three heads: (i) it
was the command of Zeus; (ii) Agamemnon was a
great king; (iii) the real parent of a child is the father,
the mother being only the nurse. To prove this last
point Apollo instances the president herself, Athena,
born of no mother but from the head of Zeus. He ends
by promising that Orestes, if acquitted, will be a firm
and useful ally to Athens. The goddess now declares
the pleading at an end, but before the vote is taken she
delivers a speech to the jury, proclaiming that she now
and hereby founds the Areopagite Court which shall for
ever keep watch over the welfare of Athens by the repression
of crime. The judges advance one by one and
vote secretly; but before the votes are counted Athena
gives her ruling that if an equal number are cast on
either side Orestes shall be acquitted, for she gives her
casting vote in his favour.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The votes are counted and
found equal, and the goddess proclaims that Orestes is
free. Apollo departs, and Orestes breaks forth into
thanksgiving and promises that Argos shall ever be the
friend of Athens. He leaves Athena and her citizens
confronted by the Furies, who raise cries of frantic indignation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
turning their rage upon Athens and threatening
to blight the soil, the flocks, and the people. Athena
seeks to placate them by offering a habitation and
worship in Attica. For a time they refuse to listen, but
after their fourth song of vengeance they relent. Athena
promises that they are to become kindly earth-deities<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
domiciled in Attica, blessing the increase of crops, of
herds, and of the family. The citizens, with torches in
their hands, form a procession led by Athena, and conduct
the new divinities to their dwelling in a cave beneath
the Acropolis.</p>

<p>It remains to deal with the literary and religious
aspects of the play. The poet sketches Orestes in but
a rudimentary style. There is, indeed, hardly any character-drawing
in him; he is simply any brave, sensitive,
religious man. The “human interest” is almost confined
to the gods, without our forgetting that they are surrounded
by human auditors. Athena and the Furies
are made to live by a few noble sweeping strokes;
Athena, the majestic presentment of Olympian wisdom
and the visible head of her favoured city; the Furies
majestic in their rage, unanswerable in their claim that
punishment of crime cannot be done away if the world
is to endure. Apollo is a curious study, less sublime
than we expected. His manner under cross-examination
by the Furies is a little too human; indeed he loses his
temper. The fact is that, though Æschylus has no desire
to treat Apollo irreverently, he is by no means concerned
to depict a perfect being; and for two reasons.
Firstly, he insists on reminding us that Apollo is but
the minister of Zeus; it is Zeus only whom he is bent
on exalting. Secondly, he knows well that his audience,
as between the Furies and Apollo, have a strong bias
in favour of the latter. The poet does acquit Orestes,
but it is of the deepest importance in his eyes that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
should not complacently regard the Furies as mere
malicious fiends, routed by a gloriously contemptuous
Olympian; the Furies may be wrong, perhaps, but
<i>prima facie</i> they have a terribly strong case. Therefore
in the scene of the pleadings they at least hold their own.
Apollo may be more right than they; he is emphatically
not their superior, his personal fiat is not a spiritual sanction
profounder than theirs. Neither party has got to
the root of things. The Furies say: “This man shed
the blood of a kinswoman; he must be for ever damned”.
Apollo says: “He has not sinned, for Zeus bade him
act thus”. The acquittal of Orestes is not the solution
of this disagreement, it is but the beginning; we can
hardly understand the dispute as yet.</p>

<p>We thus come to the religious aspect of the <i>Eumenides</i>.
Æschylus is of course too sincere to be satisfied,
or to allow us to be satisfied, with the fact that Orestes
actually escapes. His pursuers attack not the Argive
prince only; much of their language is an indictment
of Apollo, and ultimately of Zeus. It is very well
for Apollo to revile them as “beasts detested by
the gods,”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> but the gods are themselves arraigned.
The earth-powers stand for the principle that sin,
especially bloodshed, must be punished; this demand
is recognized as just by Athena,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and is not repudiated
by Apollo. Yet Zeus, the Sovereign of all things,
extends his hand over the man who has fallen under
their sway by his act. How shall these claims be
reconciled?</p>

<p>The solution of Æschylus is not unlike that which
(it appears) he offered at the end of the Prometheus-trilogy.
We are to imagine that we witness the events
of a time when Zeus himself has not attained to full
stature. His face is set towards the perfection of
righteousness, but development awaits even him. In
the instance of Orestes, the jar between Furies and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Apollo, or more ultimately between the earth-powers
and Zeus, shows that neither party is perfectly right.
None the less, it is essential that there should be but
one master of the universe, and the Furies are compelled
to submit. But Æschylus does not lay down
his pen at this point; nothing does he avoid more
carefully than an ending which might appear as desirable
as obvious to a vulgar playwright, some showy
tableau of grovelling fiends and triumphant goddess.
The Furies themselves look for nothing less than
moral annihilation<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> as the result of defeat. But something
of which they have never dreamed—of which,
probably, no Greek in the theatre has dreamed—is in
store for them; neither victory nor defeat, but recognition
by the power to which they have been
forced to bow, assimilation to that religion from which
they have kept themselves so jealously sundered.
They are still to be mighty powers of earth, yet
their function is to be cursing no more, but blessing
only.</p>

<p>But is this a solution at all? Is it enough to hint
at the thunderbolt, to offer a bribe of power and
worship that the Furies may forget their rage against
Attica?<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> What is to become of their function as
inflexible champions of righteousness, which has been
the moral safeguard of men? This duty the goddesses
leave as a legacy to the newly-formed court of chosen
Athenians:—<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">“Loyalty and worship do I urge upon my citizens for
a polity neither anarchic nor tyrannical; fear must not
be banished utterly from the State.” These are the
words of Athena; they are also the words of Æschylus—a
solemn warning to his fellow-citizens; finally, they
are the words of the Furies themselves—the very
phrases which they have used are here borrowed—and
go far to explain why they consent to relinquish their
prerogative. First they have regarded the Areopagus
with misgiving as a possibly hostile tribunal; then
with hatred as an enemy; at the last they look upon
it with benevolence as their heir to those stern duties
which must not be suffered, under whatever ruler of
the world, to fall into oblivion. It is true at the same
time that the poet wished, for reasons of contemporary
politics, to impress upon his countrymen the sacredness
of this ancient court, then threatened with curtailment
of its powers and prestige at the hands of the popular
party led by Pericles and Ephialtes; and the manner
in which he weaves this consideration of temporal
interests into the fabric of a vast religious poem is magnificently
conceived. What in a smaller man would
have been merely a vulgar dexterity is sanctified by
religious genius. It is not the degradation of religion,
but the apotheosis of politics. The close of the
<i>Eumenides</i> is anything but an anti-climax. It is closely
knit to the body of the whole trilogy, showing the
manner in which the playwright supposes the necessary
reconciliation between Zeus and the Furies to be made
possible and acceptable. The King of Heaven is
mystically identified now and for ever with Fate.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The
joyful procession of προπομποί is the sign not only
that the moral government of the world has been set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
at last upon a sure basis, but also that this government
is already in operation and sanctifying human
institutions.</p>

<p class="tb">These seven plays are all that survive complete
of the eighty<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> tragedies and satyric dramas written by
Æschylus. Our knowledge of the lost works rests
upon some hundreds of fragments and scattered mention
or comment in ancient writers.</p>

<p>Most interesting and important are those plays
which were associated with the extant dramas; these
have been already discussed. Next in attractiveness is
the <i>Lycurgea</i> (Λυκουργεία, or trilogy of Lycurgus), to
which the <i>Bacchæ</i> of Euripides had close affinity in
subject. Lycurgus was a king of the Edoni, a Thracian
people, who opposed the religion of Dionysus when
it entered his realm, and was punished with death.
The first play, the <i>Edoni</i> (Ἠδωνοί), depicted the collision
between Dionysus and his enemy. There was
an interview in which Lycurgus taunted the god with
his effeminate looks,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and which apparently closed with
the overthrow of his palace by the might of the god.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
The longest fragment gives an interesting account of
the instruments of music used in the bacchic orgies.
The name of the second play is not certain; it was
either <i>Bassarides</i> (Βασσαρίδες) or <i>Bassaræ</i> (Βασσάραι)—the
<i>Women of the Fawn-Skin</i>. Here the anger of
Dionysus fell upon Orpheus the musician, who neglected
the new deity and devoted himself to Apollo. He was
torn to pieces by the Bacchantes and the Muses gathered
his remains, to which they gave sepulture in Lesbos.
The <i>Youths</i> (Νεανίσκοι) formed the last piece of the
trilogy; practically nothing is known of it. It was
the chorus which gave its name to the play in all three
cases. The satyric drama was called <i>Lycurgus</i>; if we
may judge from one of the three fragments the tragic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
treatment of wine was transformed into a comic discussion
of beer.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Another celebrated trilogy had for its theme the tale
of Troy. The <i>Myrmidons</i> (Μυρμιδόνες), named from the
followers of Achilles who formed the chorus, dealt with
the death of Patroclus. Achilles, withdrawn from battle
because of his quarrel with Agamemnon, is adjured by
the chorus to pity the defeat of the Greeks. He allows
Patroclus, his friend, to go forth against the Trojans.
After doing valiantly, Patroclus is slain by Hector.
The news is brought by Antilochus to Achilles, who
gives himself up to passionate lament. This play was
a favourite of Aristophanes, who quotes from it repeatedly.
In this drama occurred the celebrated simile
of the eagle struck to death with an arrow winged by
his own feathers, which was cited throughout antiquity
and which Byron paraphrased in one of his most majestic
passages.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The story was apparently continued in the
<i>Nereides</i> (Νηρηίδες). Achilles determined to revenge
Patroclus. The magic armour made for him by
Hephæstus was brought by his mother Thetis, accompanied
by her sisters, the sea-nymphs, daughters
of Nereus, who formed the chorus. The last play was
the <i>Phrygians</i> (Φρύγες) or <i>Ransom of Hector</i> (Ἕκτορος
Λύτρα) in which Priam prevailed upon Achilles to give
up the corpse of Hector for burial. It appears likely
that in the two preceding plays Æschylus followed
Homer somewhat closely. But in the <i>Ransom</i> he did
not. Besides the detail to which Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> makes
allusion, that Achilles sat for a long time in complete
silence, no doubt while the chorus and Priam offered
piteous and lengthy appeals, there are differences of conception.
In Homer, one of the most moving features
of the story is that Priam goes to the Trojan camp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
practically alone. He is met by the God Hermes who
conducts him to the tent of Achilles. Then, solitary
among his foes, he throws himself upon the mercy of
his son’s destroyer. No such effect was to be found in
Æschylus. The chorus of Phrygians accompanied their
king, and we find in a fragment of Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> a hint
of much posturing and stage-managed supplication.</p>

<p>The <i>Women of Etna</i> (Αἰτναῖαι) was produced in
Sicily at the foundation of Hiero’s new city. In the
<i>Men of Eleusis</i> (Ἐλευσίνιοι) Æschylus dealt with the
earliest struggle of Athens—the war with Eleusis, his
own birth-place. More ambitious in its topic was the
<i>Daughters of the Sun</i> (Ἡλιάδες) which dealt with the
fall of Phaethon. A pretty fragment alludes to that
“bowl of the Sun” so brilliantly described by Mimnermus,
in which the god travels back by night from
West to East. It seems that the geographical enumerations
prominent in the Prometheus-trilogy were found
here also, tinged less with grimness and more with
romance. In the <i>Thracian Women</i> (Θρῇσσαι) Æschylus
treated the same theme as Sophocles in the <i>Ajax</i>. It
is significant that the death of the hero was announced
by a messenger. Possibly, then, it was a desire for
novelty which caused the younger playwright to diverge
so strikingly from custom as to depict the actual suicide.
The <i>Cabiri</i> (Κάβειροι) was the first tragedy to portray
men intoxicated. In the <i>Niobe</i> (Νιόβη) occurred splendid
lines quoted with approbation by Plato:—</p>

<p class="noindent">The <i>Philoctetes</i> is the subject of an interesting essay by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Dio Chrysostom.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> All the three great tragedians wrote
plays<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> of this name, and Dio offers a comparison.
Naturally, but for us unfortunately, he assumes a knowledge
of these works in his readers; still, certain facts
emerge about the Æschylean work. Men of Lemnos—the
island on which Philoctetes had been marooned—constituted
the chorus. To them the hero narrated
the story of his desertion by the Greeks, and his
wretched life afterwards. Odysseus persuaded him to
come and help the Greeks at Troy by a long recital
of Hector’s victory and false reports of the death of
Agamemnon and Odysseus. Neither Neoptolemus
nor Heracles (important characters in Sophocles) seems
to have been introduced by Æschylus. Dio comments
on the style and characterization. The primitive
grandeur of Æschylus, he remarks, the austerity
of his thought and diction, appear appropriate to the
spirit of tragedy and to the manners of the heroic age.
Odysseus is indeed clever and crafty, but “far removed
from present-day rascality”; in fact he seems “absolutely
patriarchal when compared with the modern
school”. That the play is named after one of the
persons and not the chorus, leads one to attribute it to a
comparatively late period in the poet’s life. Finally, the
<i>Weighing of the Souls</i> (Ψυχοστασία) is remarkable for
the scene in Heaven, modelled upon a passage in the
<i>Iliad</i>, where Zeus, with Thetis, mother of Achilles, on
one hand, and Eos, mother of Memnon, on the other,
weighed in a balance the souls or lives of the two
heroes about to engage in fight before Troy.</p>

<p class="tb">In attempting a general appreciation of this poet
one should avoid making the error of judging him
practically by the <i>Agamemnon</i> alone. Otherwise we
cannot hope to understand the feeling of fifth century
Athens towards him. Most of his work has vanished,
but the collection we possess seems fairly representative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
of his development; if we give weight to his comparatively
inferior plays we may understand the feeling of
two such different men as Aristophanes and Euripides.
Incredible as it may seem, by the end of that century
Æschylus was looked on as half-obsolete. Euripides
thought of him much as Mr. Bernard Shaw now thinks
of Shakespeare; Aristophanes, lover of the old order
as he was, seems to have felt for the man who wrote the
<i>Agamemnon</i> a breezy half-patronizing affection; while
putting him forward in the <i>Frogs</i> to discomfit Euripides,
he handles the older poet only less severely than he
handles the younger. He and his contemporaries
viewed Æschylus as a whole, not fixing their eyes
exclusively on his final trilogy.</p>

<p>Let us consider him first as a purely literary artist,
a master of language, leaving his strictly dramatic
qualities on one side. We find that his three great
notes are grandeur, simplicity, and picturesqueness. To
describe the grandeur of Æschylus is a hopeless task;
some notion of it may be drawn from the account of his
individual works just given, but the only true method is
of course direct study of his writings. The lyrics, from
the <i>Supplices</i> to the <i>Eumenides</i>, touch the very height
of solemn inspiration and moral dignity; as it has been
often said, his only peers are the prophets of Israel.
The non-lyrical portions of his work, stiff with gorgeous
embroidery, are less like the conversations of men and
women than the august communings of gods; that
majestic poem which has for auditors the Sun himself,
the rivers, the mountains, and the sea, and for background
the whole race of man, is not merely written
about Prometheus: it might have been written by
Prometheus. But such magnificence has its perils.
The mere bombast for which Kyd and even Marlowe
are celebrated, and which has given us such things as</p>

seems that such extravagances, “the beefy words, all
frowns and crests, the frightful bogey-language,”<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
occurred entirely in the lost plays. But in those which
survive we have much bombast of phrase, if not of
words; the “thirsty dust, sister and neighbour of
mud,”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Zeus, “chairman of the immortals,”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">“drill these words through thine ears with the quiet
pace of thy mind,”<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> “breathe upon him the gale of
blood and wither him with the reeking fire of thine
entrails”.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Æschylus, indeed, like all poets, understood
the majesty of sounding words, apart from their meaning.
As Milton gloried in the use of magnificent proper
names, so does the Athenian delight in thunderous
elaboration. Therefore, not possessing the chastity of
Sophocles, he is occasionally barbarous and noisy;
Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> jests at his lyrics for their frequent exhibition
of sound without sense.</p>

<p>Oddly combined with this occasional savagery of
phrase is the second quality of simplicity. Æschylus,
so far as we know, was the creator of tragic diction.
However greatly his successors improved upon him in
flexibility, grace, and subtlety, it was he who first worked
the mine of spoken language, strove to purify the ore,
and forged the metal into an instrument of terror and
delight. But even the creator needed practice in its
use. He has a giant’s strength, and at times uses it
like a giant, not like a gymnast. In his earlier work
he seems muscle-bound, clumsy in the use of his new-found
powers. He wields the pen as one more familiar
with the spear; the warrior of Marathon does fierce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
battle with particles and phrases; he strains ideas to
his breast and wrestles with elusive perfection; we seem
to hear his panting when at last he erects as trophy
some noble speech or miraculous lyric. This stiffness
of execution persists faintly even in the <i>Oresteia</i>. The
earlier tragedies, both in the characters and in the
language, are rough-hewn, for all their glory. In the
<i>Supplices</i> this stark simplicity is actually the chief note.
Here, more than elsewhere, the poet has a strange way
of writing Greek at times as if it were some other
language. The opening words of the Egyptian herald—σοῦσθε
σοῦσθ’ ἐπὶ βᾶριν ὅπως ποδῶν<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>—can only be
described as barbaric mouthing. Throughout this play
the complete absence of lightness and speed, the crude
beginnings of greatness, a certain bleak amplitude, are
all typical of a new art-form not yet completely evolved.
The poet, himself the beginner of a new epoch, fills us
with an uncanny impression of persons standing on the
threshold of history with little behind them but the
Deluge. In the <i>Persæ</i> and the <i>Septem</i> there is the
same instinct for spaciousness, but the canvas shows
more colour and less of the bare sky, for we are now
more conscious of background, the overthrow of Persia
and the operations of human sin.</p>

<p>The third characteristic, picturesqueness, is the most
obvious of all. The few instances of bombastic diction
noted above are but the necessary failures of a supreme
craftsman. Homer does not stay to embroider his language
with metaphor, which belongs to a more reflective
age; Pindar’s tropes are splendid and elaborate, a calculated
jog to the attention. For Æschylus, metaphor
seems the natural speech, unmetaphorical language a
subtlety which requires practice. Danaus in his perplexity
ponders “at the chess-board”;<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> when the assembly
votes, “heaven bristles with right hands”;<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> an anxious
heart “wears a black tunic”;<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
    heaven “loads the scales”<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
to the detriment of Persia; the trumpet “blazes”;<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> misfortune
“wells forth”;<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Amphiaraus “reaps the deep
furrow of his soul”;<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> “the sea laughs in ripples without
number”;<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> the snow descends “with snowy wings”;<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
for an intrepid woman “hope treads not the halls of
fear”;<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> “Fate the maker of swords is sharpening her
weapon”;<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Anarchy in the State is the “mixing of mud
with water”.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The best example of all is the celebrated
beacon-speech in the <i>Agamemnon</i>: “The flame is conceived
as some mighty spirit.... It ‘vaults over the
back of the sea with joy’; it ‘hands its message’ to
the heights of Macistus; it ‘leaps across’ the plain of
Asopus, and ‘urges on’ the watchmen; its ‘mighty
beard of fire’ streams across the Saronic gulf, as it
rushes along from peak to peak, until finally it ‘swoops
down’ upon the palace of the Atreidæ.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Allied to this picturesqueness of phrase is a picturesqueness
of characterization: Æschylus loves to give
life and colour even to his subordinate persons. Attic
literature is so frugal of ornament that the richness of
this writer gains a double effect. The watchman of the
<i>Agamemnon</i> has the effect of a Teniers peasant; Orestes’
nurse in the <i>Choephorœ</i> is a promise of the nurse of
Juliet; the Egyptian herald conveys with amazing skill
the harem-atmosphere—one seems to see that he is a
negro; Hermes in the <i>Prometheus</i> is the father of all
stage courtiers. Again, direct appeals to the eye were
made by various quaint devices—the winged car of the
Ocean Nymphs, their father’s four-legged bird, and the
“tawny horse-cock” (whatever it was) which so puzzled
Dionysus.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Such curiosities were meant merely as a
feast for the idle gaze, at first; but the serious mind of
the poet turned even these to deeper issues. The red
carpets of the <i>Agamemnon</i>, and the king treading upon
them in triumph, provided a handsome spectacle to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
eye; but the mind at the same instant fell into grimmer
bodements as the doomed man seemed to walk in blood.
So, too, the word-pictures which please the ear are raised
by genius to an infinitely higher power, as in that same
scene, when Agamemnon complains of the waste of
purple stuffs, and the queen seems but to say that there
is dye enough left in the sea: “There is a sea, and who
shall drain it dry?” The meaning of the words is as
inexhaustible as the ocean they tell of, revealing abysses
of hatred and love hellishly intertwined, courage to bear
any strain, an hereditary curse whose thirst for blood is
never sated, a bottomless well of life.</p>

<p>If we now consider Æschylus on his purely dramatic
side, as a builder of plays, we find again the three distinctive
notes, grandeur, simplicity, and picturesqueness.
The grandeur of his architecture is an authentic sign of
his massive genius—it by no means depends on his
selection of divine or terrific figures; the <i>Persæ</i> and the
<i>Septem</i> are witnesses. It is the outcome of his conception
of life as the will of God impinging upon human
character. Æschylus knows nothing about “puppets
of fate.” Around and above men is a divine government
about which many things may be obscure, but of
which we surely know that it is righteous and the guardian
of righteousness. Man by sin enters into collision with
the law. The drama of Æschylus is his study of the
will and moral consciousness of man in its efforts to
understand, to justify to itself, and to obey that law.
Supreme justice working itself out in terms of human
will—such is his theme. Another source of grandeur
lies in the perspectives which his works reveal. This,
perhaps most evident in the <i>Prometheus</i>, runs through
the other plays; and a technical result of this power is
the skill with which the whole trilogies are wrought.
To compose trilogies rather than simple tragedies shows
indeed the instinct for perspective working at the very
heart of his method. Again, if this instinct likens his
work to painting, still more are we led by historical considerations
to make a comparison with sculpture. It has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
been said<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> that the earliest play is “like one of those
archaic statues which stand with limbs stiff and countenance
smiling and stony.” This brilliant simile is full
of enlightenment. Just as those early Greek statues
which seem to the casual observer merely distressing are
to be contrasted, not with the achievement of Praxiteles
but with non-Hellenic art, the winged bulls of Assyria
and the graven hummocks which present the kings of
Egypt, whereupon we perceive the stirrings of life and
beauty; so should the <i>Supplices</i>, were it only in our
power, be compared to the rigid declamations from which,
to all seeming, tragedy was born. In the <i>Supplices</i>
tragedy came alive like the marble Galatea. Dædalus
was reputed to have made figures that walked and ran;
it is no fable of Æschylus, but the history of his art.</p>

<p>Simplicity, the second note of Æschylus, needs little
demonstration after the detailed account of his plots.
The four earlier works contain each the very minimum
of action. The characterization is noble, but far from
subtle. All the persons are simply drawn, deriving
their effect from one informing concept and from the
circumstances to which they react. Euripides in the
<i>Frogs</i><a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> fastens upon this, remarking, “You took over
from Phrynichus an audience who were mere fools”.
A later generation demanded smartness and subtlety;
Æschylus was anything but artful, and so the same
critic accuses him of obscurity in his prologues.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The
<i>Oresteia</i> exhibits a marked advance in construction.
Leaving on one side the vexed question of the plot in
the <i>Agamemnon</i>,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> we observe in the <i>Choephorœ</i> what we
may call intrigue. Orestes has a device for securing
admission to the palace; the libations by which Clytæmnestra
intends to secure herself are turned into a weapon
against her; the chorus intercept the nurse and alter
her message so as to aid the conspiracy. This ingenuity
is perhaps due to the influence of Sophocles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>Thirdly, what may be termed picturesqueness in
structure is a matter of vital import for Æschylus. To
write dramatically is to portray life by exhibiting persons,
the vehicles of principles, in contact and collision. For
an artist of the right bent, it is not difficult to select a
scene of history or an imagined piece of contemporary
life which under manipulation and polishing will show
the hues of drama. But the earliest of dramatists turns
aside in the main from such topics. His favourite
themes are the deepest issues, not of individual life, but
the life of the race, or the structure of the universe.
What is the relation between Justice and Mercy? Why
is the omnipotent omniscient? May a man of free will
and noble instincts escape a hereditary curse sanctioned
by heaven? Such musings demand surely a quiet unhurried
philosophic poem, not the decisive shock of
drama. Æschylus devoted himself, nevertheless, not to
literature in the fashion of Wordsworth, but to tragedy.
How was he to write a play about Justice and Mercy,
to discuss a compromise between the rigidity of safe
government and the flexibility of wise government?
Justice and Mercy are both essential to the moral
universe, says the theologian—but they are incompatible.
Friendship and strife are both essential to the
physical universe, says Empedocles—but how can they be
wedded? This impossibility is everywhere, and everywhere
by miracle it is achieved. This union of opposites
pervades the world, from the primitive protoplasm which
must be rigid to resist external shock but flexible to
grow and reproduce itself, to the august constitution of
the eternal kingdom in which “righteousness and peace
have kissed each other”. Where, then, is the playwright
to find foothold? His innumerable instances merge into
one another. Æschylus, with noble audacity, lifts us
out of the current of time and imagines a special instance,
an instance which presents the problem in dual form—for
example the human tangle of the Atridean house and
the superhuman conflict between Zeus and the powers
of earth. It is assumed that there has been no earlier,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
less decisive, jar. In the future, there will be no more.
The great question is raised once for all in its completest,
most difficult form. The gradual processes of time are
abolished. Thus Atlas<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> is punished by condemnation
to the task of upholding heaven for ever; how it was
sustained before his offence is a question we must not
raise. Hypermnestra<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> is put on trial for disobeying her
father that her husband may live. She is saved by
Aphrodite; and the innumerable cases of conflicts of
duty which have broken hearts in days past are summed
up (rather than disregarded) by this ultimate example.
In the <i>Oresteia</i> a man is hunted well-nigh to death by
fiends because he has obeyed the will of God. Why?
It can only be said that until the judgment in the
<i>Eumenides</i> all is nebulous, the world is being governed
desperately as by some committee of public safety;
morals, justice, and equity are still upon the anvil.
After this one case no man will ever again be tortured
like Orestes; nor indeed, we may conjecture, will the
oracles of Zeus issue behests so merciless as that which
he received.</p>

<p>Finally, something should be said about Æschylus’
views on religion. Other subjects had an interest for
him, geography, history, and politics,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> but his never-failing
and profound interest in religion overshadows
these. Not only was he interested in the local cults of
Athens, as were his great successors; he is at home in
the deepest regions of theology. Even more than this,
he brings back strange messages from the eternal world,
he seeks to purify the beliefs of his fellows by his deep
sense of spiritual fact; he writes the chronicles of Heaven
and bears witness to the conquests of the Most High.
Among Greek writers he is the most religious, and, with
Plato and Euripides, most alive to the importance of belief
to the national health. He is not ashamed of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
traditional gospel when he thinks it true: “the act comes
back upon him that did it; so runs the thrice-old saw”.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
Still less is he ashamed to denounce false maxims:
“From of old hath this hoary tale been spread abroad
among men, that when prosperity hath grown to its
full stature it brings forth offspring and dies not childless;
yea, that from good hap a man’s posterity shall reap
unendingly a harvest of woe. But I stand apart from
others, nor is my mind like theirs.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> This originality
and sincere mood is shown everywhere. Already we
have noted how earnestly just he is towards the claims
of the Furies. The case was no foregone conclusion for
him. To realize how terrible the quarrel was in his eyes
we have only to imagine our feelings had Apollo been
defeated. And defeated he nearly is; the human judges
vote equally.</p>

<p>The poet’s clear thinking and ethical soundness are
shown in his treatment of the hereditary Curse or Até
(ἄτη). Some great sin brings this curse into being, and
it oppresses the sinner’s family with an abnormal tendency
to further crime. But the descendants are not forced to
sin. The action of the curse, according to Æschylus, is
upon their imagination. When some temptation to
wrong-doing occurs to them, as to all men, they may
suddenly remember the curse and exclaim in effect:
“Why struggle against this temptation? our house is
ridden by an Até which drives us to sin”. Thus they
rush upon evil with a desperate gusto and abandon.
So Eteocles<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> cries:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Since Heav’n thus strongly urges on th’ event,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Laius’ race, by Phœbus loathed, all, all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the wind sweep down the stream of Hell!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the curse can be resisted. The house of Atreus fed
its curse from generation to generation by criminal bloodshed.
But Orestes shed blood only at the behest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Heaven, and so combined necessary vengeance with innocence.
Thus the curse was laid to rest.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>The revision to which he subjected the myths of
popular religion is therefore characteristic. There were
four leading phenomena which it was necessary somehow
to co-ordinate if a consistent faith was to be possible.
First, there was the Olympian hierarchy, the object of
the State-religion at Athens as elsewhere. Secondly,
there was Chthonian religion or the worship of earth-powers.
Thirdly, there was the vague, less personal,
power called Fate. And lastly, there was conscience,
the feeling that sin polluted the soul, not merely the
hands of the wrong-doer.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> None of these four conceptions
was by itself adequate in the eyes of Æschylus.
The Olympians, though the rulers of men and on the
whole their friends, were according to universal report
stained with all the crimes of humanity. The earth-deities
ruled only by fear; they punished but they did not
inspire; nor was it clear that their power was not somehow
subordinate to that of Heaven. Fate was impersonal
and had no moral aspect on which men could base
their understanding of its law. The conception of personal
righteousness had no visible basis in the scheme of
things; there was no power outside man who guaranteed
the authenticity of his thirst for holiness. When once
Æschylus set out on his self-appointed path, he brooked
no obstacle. First, as to the Olympian gods, he explains
away the difficulties. Most of them are frankly
ignored,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> edifying accounts being substituted for them;
some few are accepted with a shrug.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Zeus is no longer
the head of a turbulent confederacy; he has become the
father and lord of powers who obey him implicitly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
derive their prerogatives from his will. The earth-deities,
as has been shown, surrender their moral functions
and become mere spirits of fertility, localized, in
the case of the Furies, upon Attic soil. Nothing, even
in this writer, is more audacious than the monotheistic
fervour which transforms these terrific beings into a
species of fairy. Fate, again, is mysteriously assimilated
to Zeus; the unvarying laws of the universe are invested
with a moral tendency and a personal will. And lastly,
the conception of human holiness finds its sanction in
that will. Zeus bids us be righteous, and our faith
affirms that he will punish the guilty and reward the
good.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="smaller">THE WORKS OF SOPHOCLES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Of more than a hundred plays written by
Sophocles, only seven survive entire. These
shall now be discussed in what is probably
the chronological order.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ajax</span><a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> (Αἴας, sometimes called Αἴας μαστιγοφόρος,
from his scourging of the cattle) cannot be dated.
It is generally agreed that this work and the <i>Antigone</i>
are the two earliest extant plays; which of the two was
produced first it is difficult to say.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Perhaps an important
feature of technique settles this—both tragedies
need three actors, but the <i>Ajax</i> in this respect is more
tentative than the <i>Antigone</i>.</p>

<p>The scene is laid before the tent of Ajax on the
plain of Troy. Enraged by the action of the Greeks
in awarding to Odysseus instead of to himself the arms
of the dead Achilles, Ajax sought to slay Agamemnon,
Menelaus, and others in their sleep. The goddess
Athena sent madness upon him so that he slaughtered
cattle in their stead. Coming to himself he realizes
his shame, and eluding his friends—the chorus of
Salaminian sailors and the Trojan captive, Tecmessa
(who has borne him a son),—he retires to a lonely spot
by the sea and falls upon his sword. His brother
Teucer returns too late to save him, but in time to
confront and defy Agamemnon and Menelaus, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
have decreed that Ajax’ body shall be left unburied.
At length Agamemnon is induced by Odysseus to forgo
his purpose.</p>

<p>No Greek play gains so much by re-reading as
the <i>Ajax</i>. The character of the hero steadily grows
on us; it is not that we admire him more, but that
we feel a deeper sympathy. As he gains in clearness,
he lifts the other characters into the light. Ajax is a
man dowered with nobility, sensitiveness, and self-reliance,
but ruined by the excess of those qualities. His
nobility has become ambition, his sensitiveness morbidity,
his self-reliance pride. He offends Heaven by his
haughtiness, and is humbled; then, rather than accept
his lesson, he shuns disgrace by suicide. This resolution
is strong enough to overbear the appeals of Tecmessa
and the silent sway of his little son; he faces death
calmly and even thoughtfully. Grouped round the
central figure are first Tecmessa and Teucer, and on
a lower plane Odysseus, Menelaus, Agamemnon, and
the chorus. Athena stands apart.</p>

<p>Tecmessa is one of the loveliest creations of Sophocles;
there clings about her a silvery charm
which is strangely refreshing amid the turbid grandeur
of the play. Tenderness, patience, courage—these are
commonplace enough upon the stage; yet Sophocles
has made of them something frail but indestructible,
and touched her with his own greatest charm—an
unearthly eloquence of which we shall speak later:—</p>

<p class="noindent">When Ajax is dead, it is she, not Teucer (as Ajax
had hoped) who finds the body, and this marvel of
quiet tenderness gleams forth again. She hardly
laments at all; the chorus who accompany her are
more moved. So accustomed is she to sorrow and
self-repression that grief is her natural element; she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
utters a few quiet words of noble pity, and when the
sailors press forward to view the dead she gently
says “ye must not look on him,” and covers the body
with a robe. Her self-command is so absolute that
it can bend; she will even say “Alas! What shall
I do?” when confronted with a mere perplexity about
the removal of the corpse.</p>

<p>Teucer is Ajax himself without the madness and
the illumination; he stands in the same relation to his
half-brother as Mark Antony in Shakespeare to Julius
Cæsar; he is an ideal presenter of Ajax’ claims if they
are to be presented at all to people like Menelaus and
Agamemnon. Menelaus is more active in debate, more
brilliantly vulgar, than his brother, who wisely takes
his stand upon general principles, and hardly mentions
at all the decision not to bury Ajax. Agamemnon is
conscious of his weak position; finally, he succeeds in
retiring without complete loss of dignity. Odysseus is
apparently intended as the antithesis to Ajax—discreet,
forgiving, and impressed by the power of Heaven.
Though but a sketch, he is a striking figure; after
all the anguish and outcry, it is the normal man who
emerges as the pivot of events and saves the situation.</p>

<p>The Salaminian sailors offering no special features,
there remains only Athena, who dominates the “prologue”.
In contrast with the fully-developed beings
whom we have studied in the <i>Oresteia</i> she is amazingly
crude. The fact is that we ought not to consider her
“character” at all. She is simply divine punishment
roughly (but not casually) personified and given the
name Athena. She gloats over the madman whom
even the mortal standing beside her pities, and the
only lesson she draws for him is that men must shun
pride. It is natural, but useless, to call her a fiend; she
serves merely as the visible and audible symbol that
Heaven punishes haughty independence of spirit.
That instead of mere evolutions of puppets we have a
striking drama is due simply to the fact that Sophocles
is interested far more in Ajax than in the goddess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>Two real or apparent defects must be noted.
Firstly, we are shocked, or we should be shocked, by
the actions (if not the character) of Ajax—a point often
disregarded, probably through an idea that his bloodshed
was caused by madness. But the goddess, by so deluding
him, turned his rage from man to beast. He
makes a deliberate attempt to murder the Atridæ in their
sleep, together with an indefinitely large number of their
followers, and this in the course of a campaign. It can
hardly be doubted that the doom pronounced by the
general, that such a man (to ignore his personality for
the moment) shall not be buried, would have met with
faint reprobation, either at the time supposed or among
the contemporaries of the poet. Again, the indifference
with which Ajax treats Tecmessa amounts to sheer
brutality. Many readers have supposed that the prince
cherishes affection for her, but conceals it under a show
of roughness to avoid “breaking down”. This is a
mere fancy. Nothing in Ajax’ conduct, and practically<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
nothing in his words, betrays any interest whatsoever
in Tecmessa. The man is absorbed almost entirely by
his sense of wounded dignity. He bids an affectionate
farewell to his child, he speaks lovingly of his own
parents and of Teucer; but nothing can prevent him
from escaping disgrace by self-destruction. When about
to fall upon his sword he mingles with his farewells a
fierce behest to the Furies to destroy the whole Greek
host which has slighted him. So far as the first part of
this tragedy is concerned, Ajax is a magnificent brute;
he is better dead.</p>

<p>The second difficulty is that Ajax dies at v. 865, but
the play continues for five or six hundred lines more.
This great space is occupied by a long dispute about
his burial, which modern readers find tedious. But the
difficulty arises from a mischievous idea that the culmination
of every tragedy is the hero’s death. Often it is only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
a step towards the real crisis. In <i>Ajax</i> the theme is not
his death, but his rehabilitation: the disgrace, the suicide,
the veto on his burial, Teucer’s defiance, the persuasions
of Odysseus, are all absolutely necessary. The culminating
point is the dispute about his burial, especially
since Ajax was one of the Attic “heroes,” and the
centre of a hero’s cult was his tomb.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> This explanation
enables us to regard the whole play as an organic unity.
It helps, moreover, to meet the first difficulty—the character
of Ajax. It must be remembered that a man became
a “hero” not necessarily through any nobility or
holiness of his life. It was rather the fact that he had
passed through strange, unnatural experiences, had even
committed morbid crimes, so long as those offences were
purged by strange sufferings and death, violent, superhuman,
or pitiable. Such was Œdipus, and such is
Ajax. Greek feeling would have made a “hero” of
Lear, of Hamlet, perhaps of Othello. Ajax is a man of
essentially noble mould—this the speeches of Teucer express
admirably—who sins deeply and suffers strangely.
That he happens to evoke less admiration from us than
the other tragic figures just mentioned matters little.
Lack of tenderness towards women was the rule at
Athens; and hatred of enemies, which Ajax carried to
such insane length, was commoner still. But what of
the lowered tone which marks the end of the tragedy?
Teucer’s speech on the warlike achievements of his
brother is, indeed, beyond praise; but much of his other
remarks, and of the language held by the Atridæ, is
mere brawling. But these quarrels bring into relief the
proud nobility of the man who lies between the disputants,
dead because he would not stay to rehabilitate himself
by such bickering.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Antigone</span><a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> (Ἀντιγόνη) was produced about 441<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The scene is laid before the palace at Thebes, on
the morning after the repulse of the Argives who had
come to restore Polynices. Creon, King of Thebes,
publishes an edict that no one shall give burial to the
corpse of Polynices on pain of death. Antigone, sister
of the dead man, despite the advice of her sister Ismene,
performs the rite and is haled before Creon. She insists
that his edict cannot annul the unwritten primeval laws
of Heaven. The king, disregarding the admonitions of
his son Hæmon, betrothed to Antigone, sends her to
the cave of death. The prophet Tiresias warns him
that the gods are angered by the pollution which comes
from the unburied corpse. Urged by the chorus, Creon
relents, and hastens first to bury Polynices, then to
release Antigone, who has, however, already hanged
herself. Hæmon stabs himself by her body. On hearing
of his death his mother Eurydice, wife of Creon,
commits suicide. The play ends with Creon’s helpless
grief.</p>

<p>This play is perhaps the most admired of Sophocles’
works. But the admiration often rests on a misunderstanding.
It is customary to regard Antigone as a
noble martyr and Creon as a stupidly cruel tyrant, because
of an assumption that she must be what a similar
figure would be, and often has been, in a modern play.
Memories of Cordelia confronting Lear, of Dorothea in
<i>The Virgin Martyr</i> of Massinger and Dekker, beguile
us so that we read that character into the play. The
principle upheld by Antigone, and that upheld by Creon,
are <i>prima facie</i> of equal validity. The poet may, possibly,
agree with Antigone rather than with the king,
but the current belief, that the princess is splendidly
right and her oppressor ignobly wrong, stultifies the
play; it would become not tragedy but crude melodrama.
In judging Attic literature there is nothing
which it is more vital to remember than the immense
importance attached by Athenians to the State and its
claims. We are alive to the sanctity of human life, but
think far less of the sanctity of national life. An English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
reader, therefore, regards Creon with all the reprobation
which his treatment of Antigone can possibly deserve;
but whatever justification is inherent in the case he
almost ignores.</p>

<p>The truth is that Creon commits a terrible act owing
to a terrible provocation. His act is the insult to
Polynices’ body, which he maintains at the cost of Antigone’s
life; his justification is the fact that the dead
man, though a Theban, was attacking Thebes and
would have destroyed the State. Antigone stands for
respect to private affection, Creon for respect to the
community. It is impossible to say at the outset which
is the more important, and the problem may well be
insoluble. But it is precisely because of this that the
<i>Antigone</i> is a tragedy. To accept the customary view,
and yet insist that Sophocles is a great dramatist, is
mere superstition; the work becomes the record of an
insane murder. On <i>a priori</i> grounds, then, we may believe
that Sophocles by no means condemns Creon off-hand.
It is not satisfactory to argue that Thebes should
have been satisfied with the death of the invader.
Since he was a Theban his attack was looked on as the
foulest treachery, which merited extreme penalty, both
by way of revenge and as a warning to others. (Just
the same view is held by the authorities in the <i>Ajax</i>.)
The play presents a problem both for the king and for
his kinswoman: “I am right to punish this traitor’s
corpse; am I justified in killing others who thwart the
punishment?” “I am right to show love and pity for
my dead brother; am I justified in flouting the State?”
Antigone is only Creon over again with a different
equipment of sympathies. That one loves his country
with a cold concentration which finds enemies and
treachery everywhere, while the other passionately loves
her dead brother, should not blind us to the truth
that Antigone has all Creon’s hardness and narrowness,
and especially all his obstinacy. That tenderness and
womanly affection which we attribute to the princess are
amiable inventions of our own, except the love which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
she bears Polynices. This love is not to be in any sense
belittled, but it is simply an instinct, like that of Creon
in matters of State, an instinct to which she will, like
him, sacrifice all else. If Creon sacrifices Antigone for
his ideal, she sacrifices Hæmon for hers. He shows
brutality to his son, she to her sister. That a compromise
between the demands of the State and private
conscience is, however unwelcome, necessary, never occurs
to either party, and those who, like Hæmon and
Ismene, urge such a thought upon them are insulted.
This blindness to the psychology of Antigone has led
to actual meddling with Sophocles’ text. In her last
long speech occurs a celebrated “difficulty,” namely,
her statement<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> that if the dead man had been a child or
husband of hers, she would not thus have given her life;
but the case of Polynices is different, since (her father
and mother being dead) she can never have another
brother. These lines are generally bracketed as spurious
because unworthy of Antigone’s character and inconsistent
with the reason for her act which she has
already<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> given, namely, the “unwritten and unshaken
laws of Heaven”. Any idea that the passage was inserted
in “later times” is rendered impossible by the
fact that Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> quotes it (about 340 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and the
presumption is that the words are the poet’s own. Indeed,
the “difficulty” exists only in the minds of those
who attribute inconsistency in a character to incompetence
in the playwright. But while illogical people
exist it is hard to see why a dramatist should not depict
them. Antigone’s “reason” is stupid, no doubt, but
what could be more dramatic? It is no novelty that a
person capable of courageous action cannot argue well
about it; there is a logic of the heart that has little to
do with the logic of the brain. Antigone <i>has</i> no reasons;
she has only an instinct. Here, and here only, Sophocles
has pressed this point home, and the popular view has
no resource but to reject the passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>Whom does Sophocles himself approve, the king or
his opponent? Neither. Attention to the plot will make
this clear. The <i>peripeteia</i> or “recoil” is the revelation
that the gods are angered by the pollution arising from
the body, and that owing to their anger grave peril
threatens Creon’s family. It is this news which causes
his change of purpose. Polynices is therefore buried by
the king himself despite his edict. These facts show
that ultimately both Antigone and Creon are wrong.
Heaven is against Creon, as he is forced at last to see—Antigone’s
appeal to the everlasting unwritten laws is in
this sense justified. But Antigone is wrong also. She
should have left the gods to vindicate their own law.
Such a statement may seem ignobly oblivious of religion,
human nature, and the courage which she shows. But
it is not denied that Antigone is noble and valiant: she
may be both, yet mistaken and wrong-headed. One is
bound to consider the facts of the plot. Why is she at
first undetected yet compelled by circumstances to perform
the “burial”-rites twice? Simply to remind us
that, if Creon is resolved, she <i>cannot</i> “bury” Polynices.
The king has posted guards, who remove the pious dust
which she has scattered; and this gruesome contest
could continue indefinitely. She throws away her life,
<i>and with no possible confidence that her brother will in
the end be buried</i>. It is precisely this blindness of hers
which makes the tragedy—her union of noble courage
and unswerving affection with inability to see the crude
facts of a hateful situation. Her obstinacy brings about
the punishment of Creon’s obstinacy, for Eurydice’s
death is caused by Hæmon’s, and Hæmon’s by Antigone’s.
Had she not intervened all these lives would
have been saved. The whole action might have
dwindled to a mere revolting incident: the king’s
barbarity, the anger of the gods, and the king’s submission.
The tragedy would have disappeared: it is
Antigone’s splendid though perverse valour which
creates the drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>A difficulty of structure has been found<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> in the fact
that Creon, despite his haste to free Antigone, tarries
for the obsequies of Polynices. Why does he not save
the living first? This “problem” arises merely from
our insistence on the overwhelming importance of Antigone
and our disregard of the real perspective. The
explanation is simply that Creon has just been warned
of the grave danger to the whole State and his family
from the anger with which the gods view his treatment
of Polynices—an offence which Tiresias emphasizes far
more than that against Antigone; and the community,
nay, even the several persons of Creon’s family, are more
important than one woman.</p>

<p>The lyrics of this play are among the finest in existence.
The first ode expressing the relief of Thebes at
the destruction of the ravening monster of war, the third
which describes the persistence of sorrow from generation
to generation of the Theban princes, the brief song
which celebrates the all-compelling influence of love, with
its exquisite reminiscence of Phrynichus,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> the last lyric, a
graceful invocation to the God Dionysus, and above all,
the famous ode upon man and his quenchless enterprise,
all these are truly Attic in their serene, somewhat frigid,
loveliness.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Electra</span><a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> (Ἠλέκτρα) has by most<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
    critics been
regarded as next in time to the <i>Antigone</i>. The scene
shows the palace of Agamemnon now inhabited by
his murderers, Clytæmnestra and her lover Ægisthus.
Orestes, son of Agamemnon, returns to avenge him by
slaying his own mother Clytæmnestra; he is accompanied
by Pylades, his friend, and by an old slave.
Chrysothemis, daughter of Agamemnon and sister of
Electra, is sent by Clytæmnestra to appease the ghost
of Agamemnon, but is persuaded by Electra to pray his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
help for Orestes. The slave of Orestes brings false
news to the palace that Orestes has been killed in a
chariot-race at Delphi, so that the queen is relieved
from fear of vengeance. Chrysothemis returns, joyfully
announcing Orestes’ arrival—she has seen a lock of his
hair on the tomb; but her sister replies that he is dead.
While Electra mourns for her brother he himself brings
in an urn, pretending to be a messenger who has conveyed
home the ashes of Orestes. Electra’s lamentation
over it reveals who she is, and Orestes makes himself
known. Then the men go inside to slay Clytæmnestra,
while Electra remains watching for Ægisthus. After
the slaughter he arrives and triumphantly orders the
body to be carried forth, but when he uncovers it he
finds the corpse of Clytæmnestra. He is then driven
within to death.</p>

<p>The <i>Choephorœ</i>, the <i>Electra</i> of Sophocles, and the
<i>Electra</i> of Euripides supply the only surviving instance
in which the three tragedians handled the same story; at
present it is enough to note the differences between the
method of Sophocles and that of the <i>Choephorœ</i>. For
Æschylus the slaying of Clytæmnestra is a question of
religion and ethics, for Sophocles it is a matter of psychology,
the emotional history of Electra. He is content
to take the religious facts for granted, and then to
proceed with no misgivings to a purely human drama.
The play begins amid the bright, cheerful surroundings
of dawn and ends with happiness. When Orestes
comes forth, his sword wet with his mother’s blood, he
is entirely satisfied and untouched by any misgivings,
simply because the question of matricide has been settled
for him by Heaven. He is a personified theory of
Olympian religion. His words to Electra after the queen
is dead: “In the house all is well, if Apollo’s oracle
spoke well,”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> are the summary of Sophocles’ religious
point of view. Carefully and confidently referring the
question of this matricide to a higher judge than Man,
he proceeds to his actual business. Equally marked is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the difference between the closing sentence of the
<i>Choephorœ</i>, “Where then will end the fatal fury, when
pass into closing calm?”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and that of the later work:
“O house of Atreus, through how many sufferings hast
thou come forth at last in freedom, crowned with good
by this day’s enterprise!”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> For Sophocles the deed is
done and behind us; for Æschylus it lives to beget new
sorrows.</p>

<p>Electra dominates the action, scarcely leaving the
scene after her first entry. Though not a great
character-study, she impresses us by the pathos of her
situation and by the splendid expression of her emotions;
her lament over the funeral urn is perfect in the rhetoric
of sorrow. Almost motionless throughout the long
and varied action; the mark for successive onslaughts
of insult, misery, surprise, grief, hatred, and joy, she
is thrown into relief by all who approach her, especially
Chrysothemis, whose princely robes add emphasis to
the heroic meaning of the sordid dress worn by
her royal sister. She is a simple character and needs
little ornament; her devotion, patience, and courage
are plain to behold. But we should note the masterly,
yet unobtrusive way in which her feelings towards
Clytæmnestra are portrayed. Hating her steadily as
the slayer of Agamemnon, she cannot quite forget (as
does Euripides’ heroine) that Clytæmnestra is her
mother. After her outburst of reproach against the
queen she has enough flexibility of mind to own<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
that she is in a way ashamed of it—a simple touch
which shows Sophocles a master, not a slave, of his
own conceptions. A more subtle indication of her
spirit is shown in Electra’s speech to Chrysothemis
urging her to aid in the deed of vengeance. All she
proposes is that they should slay Ægisthus. But there
is an undercurrent of emphasis which shows<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> that she
intends the death of Clytæmnestra also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>The other personages are mostly well-drawn.
Orestes is commonplace, but the other four are distinctly
imagined. The tiny part of Ægisthus admirably
reveals the malicious upstart; Chrysothemis
is another Ismene, with more energy and lightness.
The Pædagogus reminds one of the guard in the
<i>Antigone</i> by his quaint witticisms—“if I had not been
watching at the door from the first, your plans would
have entered the house before your bodies”.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Clytæmnestra,
too, is admirable. More closely akin to an
Euripidean than to an Æschylean character, she defends
herself elaborately and gives way to fits of
ill-temper and petty rancour; but she has some
maternal feeling left—witness the confusion of emotions
with which she greets the news of Orestes’ death.</p>

<p>The sorrows and character of Electra form one
of the two great features of this tragedy. The other
is the stage-craft. First there is a distinct element
of intrigue, that is, of plot as contrived not by the poet
but by the characters. Not only do the avengers gain
access to the house by a false story; this much is to
be found already in the <i>Choephorœ</i>. There are two
distinct visitors to the house: the Pædagogus with
his tale of the fatal race, and Orestes bringing the
funeral urn. It is to this duplication—for otherwise
Clytæmnestra would have been present when the urn
was brought—that we owe the splendid scene of the
Recognition, with its introductory lament by Electra.
Again, as in Æschylus the nurse sent by Clytæmnestra
is induced to change her message to Ægisthus in a
way vital to the conspirators, so here Chrysothemis
is caused by her sister to invoke the aid of Agamemnon
against the queen instead of seeking to assuage his
wrath. Further, whereas Ægisthus might have entered
the house and been slain without more ado, Electra,
by telling him that the messengers have brought the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
very body of Orestes home, induces the king to summon
them forth with the corpse; thus the end of the play
is rendered vigorous (indeed melodramatic) by his
triumphant unveiling of the body which proves to be
that of the queen.</p>

<p>Besides these admirable strokes of a rather sophisticated
“sense of the theatre” there are powerful effects
which arise naturally from the circumstances. Clytæmnestra
offers a prayer to the very god who has sent
the avenger. Electra’s wonderful address to the ashes
of her brother gains greatly by the fact that he stands
living beside her. A splendidly dramatic effect is
obtained by the return of Chrysothemis—the most
“modern” point of the whole work. She has been
sent away for a certain purpose, but in the stress of
later happenings we forget her. Suddenly she re-appears
with news—the result of her mission—news
startling in itself, but ten times more so because of
the events which (without her knowledge) have just
occurred. Again, it is quite natural that Electra should
come forth while Clytæmnestra is being slain, since
some one must be on the alert for Ægisthus. This
gives opportunity for the terrible little passage where
the queen’s agonized appeals inside the house are
answered by the tense answers or comments of this
tragic figure rigid before the gate.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Œdipus Tyrannus</span><a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> (Οἰδίπους Τύραννος), often
called <i>Œdipus Rex</i> or <i>Œdipus the king</i>, is a play of uncertain
date, but it seems later than <i>Electra</i> and earlier
than <i>Philoctetes</i>.</p>

<p>The plot is rather intricate and must be given at
greater length. The scene shows the palace of Œdipus
at Thebes. The people are smitten by a pestilence;
and all look to the king, who has already sent his wife’s
brother, Creon, to ask advice from the Delphic oracle.
Creon enters, bringing tidings that Thebes will be freed
if the city is purged of those who killed Laius, the former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
king. Œdipus asks for particulars, and learns that
Laius was killed by some robbers. Only one man escaped.
The king calls upon the slayer to declare himself,
promising no worse treatment than exile; he asks
also any man who knows the guilty one to speak. If
no one confesses, he denounces civil and religious excommunication
against the unknown. The chorus-leader
suggests that the prophet Tiresias should be consulted;
Œdipus replies that he has been already
summoned. The coryphæus remarks casually that some
say Laius was slain by certain wayfarers. Tiresias enters,
but shows a repugnance even to discuss the problem, till
Œdipus in a rage accuses Tiresias of complicity in the
murder. An altercation follows in which the prophet
accuses Œdipus of having killed Laius. The other,
filled with wrath, proclaims that Tiresias and Creon are
plotting to make Creon king in his stead. Tiresias
threatens the king with mysterious horrors and downfall.
Œdipus bids him begone, and rates him for a fool.
“Foolish, perhaps, in your eyes,” says the old man, “but
thought wise by the parents that begat thee.” Œdipus
is startled. “Parents? Stay! What man begat me?”
The answer is: “This day shall show thy birth and thy
destruction”. The king again bids him go. As he
turns away, Tiresias utters his farewell speech. The
murderer of Laius is here, supposed an alien, but in
reality Theban-born. Bereft of his sight and his riches he
shall go forth into a strange land, and shall be found
brother and father of his children, son and husband of
his wife, murderer and supplanter of his father. Creon
enters, dismayed by the charges of Œdipus, when the
king appears, heaps reproaches upon the supposed traitor,
and insists that Creon shall die. The noise of their dispute
brings from the palace Jocasta, sister of Creon and
wife of Œdipus; she brings about a half-reconciliation
between the two princes, and asks the cause of the
quarrel. Œdipus tells of the accusation pointed at
himself by Tiresias. Jocasta seeks to console him by
a proof that soothsaying is not trustworthy. “An oracle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
once came to Laius that he should be slain by a son of
his and mine. None the less, he was slain by foreign
robbers at a place where three roads meet; and the child,
not three days old, was cast out upon a mountain, his
ankles yoked together.” This speech, so far from comforting
the king, fills him with alarm. The phrase “a
place where three roads meet” has struck him. He
anxiously asks for a description of Laius and the number
of his followers. The replies disturb him still more, and
he asks that the single survivor, now a herdsman far
from the city, should be sent for. Jocasta asks the
reason. He tells the story of his early manhood: he is
the son of Polybus, King of Corinth, but one day a man
insulted him by saying he was no son of Polybus. The
youth asked the Delphic oracle of his birth, but the god,
instead of answering directly, announced that he was
fated to marry his mother and kill his father. Œdipus
cheated the oracle by never seeing his parents again.
On his way from Delphi he met a body of men such as
Jocasta has described, and after a quarrel slew them all.
It seems that he is himself the slayer of Laius and is
subject to the curses which he has himself uttered. His
only hope lies in the survivor who, it is understood,
always spoke of robbers, not of a single assailant. If
this is accurate, Œdipus is not meant by the recent
oracle. A messenger from Corinth enters, bringing
news that the people of that city intend to make Œdipus
their king; Polybus is dead. Jocasta exclaims that
Polybus was the man whom Œdipus feared he must
slay. She mocks at the oracle and summons Œdipus,
who shares her relief, but reminds her that his mother
still lives. The messenger asks what woman they are discussing.
“I can free you from that fear,” he exclaims;
“Œdipus is not the son of Polybus and Merope.” Further
questioning from Œdipus brings forth the explanation.
The present messenger gave Œdipus, when a babe, to
Polybus. He was found in the glens of Cithæron, where
the man was tending flocks, his ankles fastened by an
iron thrust through them. Who did this the Corinthian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
cannot say, but the man who gave him to the Corinthian
should know—another herdsman brought him, one of
the household of Laius. Œdipus asks if this man can
be found. The chorus answer that probably he is the
person already summoned, and that perhaps the queen
can tell. Œdipus turns to Jocasta, who flings him a
few words of agony and sorrow and rushes into the
house. Œdipus turns away in contempt, for he believes
that Jocasta’s distress springs from a fear that he will be
found of ignoble birth. The aged servant of Laius now
approaches, and is recognized by the Corinthian as the
man who gave him the child. A conversation of intensest
thrill follows between the two herdsmen, in which
the Corinthian is eager, while the Theban is utterly reluctant,
only answering under the direst threats from the
king. At length it becomes plain that the babe Œdipus
is the son of Laius and Jocasta. The king with a cry
of horror rushes into the palace. A slave enters and
tells how Jocasta has hanged herself, and how Œdipus
has destroyed his own sight. After an interval Œdipus
staggers forth, a sight of ghastliness and woe. Creon
now appears as ruler of the city and bids Œdipus
be hidden in the house. The wretched man asks that
he be cast forth to dwell upon Cithæron; Creon replies
that the oracle must first be consulted. Œdipus bids a
heart-broken farewell to his little daughters, and Creon
takes them all into the palace.</p>

<p>The <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i> has been universally admired
as a masterpiece, ever since the time of Aristotle, who
in his <i>Poetic</i> takes this play as a model of tragedy. The
lyrics are simple, beautiful, and even passionately
vigorous; the dialogue in language and rhythm is beyond
praise; and the tragic irony, for which this poet is
famous, is here at its height. But the chief splendour
of the work is its construction, its strictly dramatic
strength and sincerity. The events grow out of one
another with the ease of actual life yet with the accuracy
and the power of art. We should note the two great
stages: first, the king fears that he has slain Laius;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
second, that he has slain <i>his father Laius</i>. This distinction,
so vital to the growing horror, is kept admirably
clear and is especially pointed by the part of the aged
Theban. When he is summoned, it is to settle whether
Laius was slain by one man or by a company; by the
time he arrives, this is forgotten, and all wait to know
from whom he received the outcast infant. Equally
wonderful is the skill with which almost every stage in
the discovery is made to rise from the temperament of
Œdipus. He is the best-drawn character in Sophocles.
Not specially virtuous, not specially wise—though full
of love and pity for his people and vigorous in his
measures for their safety, he is too imperious, suspicious,
and choleric. His exaggerated self-confidence, dangerous
in a citizen, is almost a crime in a prince. The only
notable virtue in his character is the splendid moral
courage with which he faces facts, nay, more, with which
he insists on unearthing facts which he might have left
untouched. And the core of the tragedy is that this
virtue of Œdipus, his insistence on knowing the truth,
is the source of his downfall. Had he not sent for
Tiresias, Tiresias would not have come forward. Had
he not urged the prophet to reply, Tiresias would not
have uttered his accusations. By these apparently mad
charges, Œdipus is stung into accusing Tiresias of plotting
with Creon. This in turn brings Creon to the
palace. The anger with which he reviles Creon causes
a dispute which draws Jocasta from the house. Then,
to calm Œdipus, she gives him the dreadful “consolation”—that
oracles have no weight—which first makes
the king fear he may have done the deed which is
plaguing Thebes. And so to the end. One exception
to this sequence should be noticed. The arrival of the
Corinthian messenger at this moment is purely accidental.
Without it, the witness of the old retainer
would have fastened upon Œdipus the slaying of Laius
(not known to be the king’s father); and he would have
gone forth from the city, but not as a parricide; moreover,
the relation between him and the queen would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
have remained unknown. Judged by the standard of
the whole play, this fact constitutes a flaw in construction.
Why did not the poet contrive that the news of Polybus’
death should arrive, and arrive now, as the direct
result of something said or done by Œdipus, just as the
arrival of the old Theban, with his crushing testimony,
is due to the king’s own summons? No doubt this
occurrence is meant to mirror the facts of life, which
include accidents as well as events plainly traceable to
character.</p>

<p>At this point should be mentioned other possible
faults, whether inherent in the drama or antecedent to it.
Some of the preliminary facts are to a high degree unlikely.
These points are three. First, Œdipus and
Jocasta, though each separately has received oracular
warning about a marriage, make no kind of inquiry at
the time of their own wedding. Secondly, Œdipus all
these years has never heard or inquired into the circumstances
in which Laius was killed. Third, Jocasta has
never yet been told of the incident at Corinth which
sent Œdipus to Delphi; indeed she has apparently not
even heard that he is the son of the king and queen of
Corinth.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Within the play itself is the strange feature
that when Tiresias accuses Œdipus of slaying Laius and
hints darkly at greater horrors—hints which in spite of
their obscurity might surely (one would think) have
united themselves in the mind of Œdipus with the
oracle of long ago—Œdipus is merely moved to fury,
not to misgiving.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Now of the first three difficulties it
must be owned that despite the palliatives suggested,
they are irritating. These things are “impossible,” or,
if not, they are oddly irrational, which is the same thing
so far as the enjoyment of dramatic art is concerned.
They are, however, to be explained thus. The unquestioning
marriage of Œdipus and Jocasta is a <i>datum</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the legend with which the poet could not tamper. All
that the dramatist could do he did—he placed the unlikely
fact “outside the plot”<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and dwelt on it as little
as possible. Indeed, he hints at some sort of excuse—the
confusion in Thebes owing to the oppression of
the Sphinx.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Next, the postponement of explanations
about the death of Laius and the exile of Œdipus
from Corinth is a direct result of dramatic treatment.
Just as Æschylus,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> in order to handle dramatically a
religious question, the bearings of which fill the whole of
time, insists on contracting the issue to a single great
instance, so Sophocles forces into the compass of one
day’s happenings the life of years. In actuality, this
tragedy would have been spread over a great lapse of
time. The climax and the horror would have been
much the same essentially, but the poet presents the
whole in a closely-knit nexus of occurrence, so as to
make the spectator feel the full impact undissipated by
graduations.</p>

<p>The difficulty concerning Tiresias is of another sort.
Œdipus’ apparent madness is not so great as it seems.
Not only is he by his rank and superb self-confidence
shielded from misgivings, not only is he already suspicious
that the murderer must be some treacherous
Theban,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> but he has now lost his temper, and has just
been furious enough to accuse Tiresias himself of complicity
in the deed. It is therefore easy for him to
assume that the prophet in his turn is only uttering
his accusations as a wild insult.</p>

<p>It might also be asked, why is not the scene with
Jocasta, in which she fortifies the king against soothsayers
and oracles, not placed at the end of the Tiresias-episode?
This question leads one to suppose that there
is great importance in the quarrel with Creon which intervenes
between the departure of Tiresias and the queen’s
appearance. Its importance clearly is, partly to depict
Œdipus more plainly, by contrast with his equable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
kinsman, but most of all to give force and impressiveness
to the end of the play, in which Creon appears
as king. After the appalling climax of the play, and
the frightful return of the blind Œdipus, there is danger
that Creon’s entry will fall flat.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> But with faultless
skill Sophocles has prepared the ground so well that
when the agony is at its worst our interest is not indeed
increased, but refreshed and relieved by the appearance
of this man whom we have forgotten, but whom
we recognize in a flash as being now the pivot of
events. This admirable stroke reminds one of the
return of Chrysothemis in the <i>Electra</i>, but it is far
more powerful.</p>

<p>Another feat of dramatic power must be noted,
marvellous even where all is masterly: the re-appearance
of Œdipus after the climax. Nothing in Greek tragedy
is more common than for a person after learning frightful
news to rush within the doors in despair. But he
does not return; a messenger tells the news of his
fate. In this play news is indeed brought of the bloody
deeds that have befallen. Then comes a sight almost
too appalling for art: the doors open and the man of
doom staggers into the light of day once more. Spiritually
he is dead, but he may not destroy himself since
he cannot go down to Hades where his father and
mother dwell. He must live, surviving himself, as
it were a corpse walking the upper earth. The waters
of doom have closed over his head, but he re-appears.</p>

<p>Jocasta is more slightly drawn than Œdipus, yet
what we have suffices. Two features are stressed by
the poet—her tenderness for Œdipus and her flippant
contempt in regard to the oracles. This last is clearly
a dramatic lever of great power; through it the king
is first brought to suspect that he is the guilty man.
It has a strong and pathetic excuse. Because of the
oracle, she was robbed of her child and yet all in vain—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
infant not yet three days old was cast away, but
none the less Laius was killed. It is precisely her
rage against the oracle for cheating her which brings
to Œdipus the knowledge that it has been fulfilled.
Further than this Sophocles has not characterized the
queen; he places an ordinary woman in a situation
of extraordinary horror and pathos, leaving us to feel
her emotions, without any elaboration of his own.
To read the conversation between Œdipus and the
Corinthian, with the short colloquy of Œdipus and
Jocasta which follows, is to experience as perhaps
nowhere else can be experienced that “purgation of
pity and terror” which is the function of tragedy. It
all centres for the moment in Jocasta, yet she says
very little. We are required to imagine it for ourselves—the
intertwined amazement, joy, loathing, despair,
which fill the woman’s heart during the few minutes
for which she listens in silence to the king and the
messenger. To have lost her child at birth, then
after mourning his death for many years at length to
find that he lives, that he stands before her, mature,
strong, and kingly, but her own husband; then to
realize that not now but long ago did she recover
him, yet did not know him but loved him otherwise—this
even Sophocles has not put into speech. Only
one hint of it comes to us in the queen’s last words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἰοὺ, ἰού, δύστηνε· τοῦτο γάρ σ’ ἔχω</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">μόνον προσειπεῖν, ἄλλο δ’ οὔποθ’ ὕστερον.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">First she screams at his ignorance and would tell all
in one word “Son!” But she cannot say it, nor dare
she use again the name “husband”. All dear titles
have been forfeited by being all merited together; and
with the cry “Unhappy one!” she goes to death.</p>

<p>The two herdsmen are perfect in their degree.
Instead of mere machines for giving evidence we
have a pair of real men, subtly differentiated and delightful.
The Corinthian, as befits a man coming
from a great centre of civilization to the quieter town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
of dull Bœotians, is polite, rhetorical,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> ready of tongue,
and conscious of his address; eager and inquisitive,
he increases his importance by telling the tale piecemeal,
and will even tell it wrongly<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> for that purpose.
The Theban herdsman is an excellent foil to his brisk
acquaintance; quiet and slow, with the breeding and
dignity often found in the lowly members of a backward
community, he does his best to recall the memories
on which a king and a nation are hanging in suspense,
until he begins to see whither the questions tend;
then, only the fiercest threats can drag the truth from
his stubborn loyalty. Sophocles loved this character;
long before he appears we have a charming little description
of him from hints of Jocasta<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> and the chorus;<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
the poet has even given him one<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> of those magical lines
to which we shall come again later:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p><span class="smcap">The Women of Trachis</span><a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> (<i>Trachiniæ</i>, Τραχινίαι)
is, perhaps, the next play in chronological order. The
scene is before a house in the state of Trachis not far
from Eubœa. Deianira, the wife of Heracles, is troubled
by his absence because of an oracle which says that in
this last enterprise he shall either die or win untroubled
happiness. Hyllus, her son, goes off to help him in his
attack on the city of Eurytus in Eubœa. The messenger
Lichas brings news of Heracles’ triumph; with him are
certain captive girls, one of whom, Iole, daughter of
Eurytus, is beloved by Heracles. Deianira learns this
fact after a pathetic appeal to Lichas; then she sends
him back with a gift to Heracles—a robe which she has
anointed with the blood of the Centaur Nessus as a
charm to win back her husband’s love. After Lichas
has gone she finds by an accident that the robe is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
poisoned. Then Hyllus returns with news that his
father is dying in torments, and reproaches his mother.
She goes into the house and stabs herself. Hyllus
learns the truth, and when the dying hero is carried in,
cursing his false wife, he explains her error. Heracles
gives orders that his body is to be burnt on Mount Œta
and that Hyllus must marry Iole.</p>

<p>It is customary to regard the <i>Trachiniæ</i> as the
weakest extant play of Sophocles. The picture of
Heracles’ physical agony near the close seems wearisomely
elaborate; and in the second place we are utterly
dissatisfied with him. He does not seem worthy of the
trepidation, awe, and grief which he has excited throughout
the play. All that follows the suicide of Deianira
appears empty or offensive. This objection may be
put<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> thus, that there are two tragedies, that of Deianira
and that of the hero. Now though it is quite true that
one can point to a thought which unifies the play—the
passion of Heracles for Iole, or more fundamentally, the
destructive power of love, this does not meet the difficulty,
which will then simply be restated thus, that the poet
has not maintained a due perspective; the story of
Deianira’s emotions and of her plan bulks too largely and
impedes what should have been the climax. But it is
a fundamental law in the criticism of Greek Tragedy,
and especially in the study of Sophocles, that we must
ponder it until we find some central thought which
accounts for the whole action and for the perspective in
which the details are placed. Such a central thought is,
after all, not lacking in the <i>Trachiniæ</i>. It is the character
of Deianira, her instincts, and her actions. This
play is in structure very similar to the <i>Ajax</i>. In the
earlier work Ajax’ death occurs far from the end, but
the latter portion is no anti-climax. So here: the topic
is not especially the death of Deianira or the end of
Heracles; it is the heroine’s love for her husband and
the attempt she makes to win him back. The poet’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
interest in her does not vanish at the moment of her silent
withdrawal. Her act, her love, survive her. What is
the result of her pathetic secret wooing of Heracles?
She has longed for two things, his return and a renewal
of his affection. To both these purposes is granted a
dim painful phantom of success. Instead of tarrying in
Eubœa Heracles hastens home, though every movement
of his litter is torment; Deianira’s passion has brought
him back, though not as she meant. As for her plan to
regain his love, it is true that when he learns her innocence
not a word of pity or affection falls from him; he
never mentions her again. It may be that he is merely
stupid and callous; it may be that he is ashamed to
recant his bitter words; it may be that he is at once
engrossed in the sudden light which is thrown upon his
own fortunes. However this may be, the promise of
Nessus on which she relied is fulfilled: “This shall be
to thee a charm for the soul of Heracles, so that he shall
never look upon any woman to love her more than thee!”<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>—the
hero’s passion for Iole is quenched. This conception
gives a wonderful beauty to what is otherwise a
mere brutality of the dying man. In forcing his son to
marry Iole he outrages our feelings as well as the heart
of Hyllus—unless we have understood. But this is his
reparation to Deianira. The charm of Nessus has been
potent indeed; the maiden is nothing to him: he “loves
no woman more” than Deianira. But this act is more
than cold reparation; it is a beautiful stroke of silent
eloquence. Heracles not only relinquishes Iole, he
gives her to his son, to one many years his junior.
This is an unconscious reply to the touching complaint<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
made by the wronged wife:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The flower of her age is in its spring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But mine in autumn. And the eyes of men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still pluck the blossom, shunning withered charms.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For him his wife was the true mate; let Iole wed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
man of her own years.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Thus the hope of Deianira is
in a terrible way half-fulfilled. Just as Heracles was
mistaken in his reading of the oracle which promised
him “rest” at the end of his toils, so was she mistaken
in the meaning she put upon the Centaur’s promise. The
oracles of heaven, by their own power and still more by
the terrible misinterpretation of man, help to mould the
play, as they mould the <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>. Thus the
<i>Trachiniæ</i> becomes a real unity. Deianira’s fate is now
no over-developed episode, for in a spiritual sense it
fills the tragedy. The doom of Heracles is no anti-climax
or tedious addendum; it is the exposition before our
eye of the havoc which can be wrought by sincere love
misled. A great structural danger lies herein, that the
picture of Heracles’ torment may eclipse the tragedy of
his wife. But the poet has surmounted this by making the
agony-scene not too long, and above all by reminding us
of Deianira through the repeated allusion to her made
by Heracles and through the explanation of Hyllus.</p>

<p>Certain peculiarities of detail in the plot strongly support
the view that Deianira is the subject of the whole
drama. First is the conduct of Lichas. This part is
carefully constructed so as to lead up to the great appeal
in which the heroine describes the might of Love. If
Lichas had really kept his secret instead of tattling to
the townsfolk, Deianira would not have known it and so
appealed to Lichas. If, on the other hand, Lichas had
not tried to deceive his mistress, she would not have
needed to offer any appeal. His conduct has been devised
solely to portray her character by means of this
marvellous speech. A second point is the way in which
Hyllus learns his mother’s innocence. After his speech
of denunciation she goes without a word into the house.
The Trachinian maidens know the truth and have heard
from Deianira<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> herself that she will not survive her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
husband, but they say nothing to Hyllus. Yet the playwright
who is here so strangely reticent allows the prince
to learn the facts in a few minutes “from the people
in the house” as he casually phrases it. The reason is
that if Hyllus were informed at once he would prevent
his mother’s suicide. This would have destroyed
the dramatic treatment without altering events. For
Deianira is not concerned in being proved innocent;
she wishes to die now that Heracles is destroyed.
Hyllus’ intervention would only mean procrastination of
death.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> In the interests of drama, it must happen now.
Further he must learn the truth as soon as she is dead,
for some one must confront Heracles with a defence of
the dead woman, if her fate and her love are, as we said,
dominant throughout the play. Here, too, there is a
resemblance between the <i>Trachiniæ</i> and the <i>Ajax</i>;
Hyllus, in this last scene, resembles Teucer championing
the fame of Ajax.</p>

<p>The character-drawing is here as admirable as elsewhere.
Lichas, well-meaning but foolish and shifty, is
contrasted with the messenger who is perfectly honest
though spiteful. Hyllus is a character of a type which
we have often discussed already—he has no personality,
and we are interested in him not because of what he is
but because of what happens to him. The women of
the chorus are simply a band of sympathetic friends.
Heracles, on the customary reading of the tragedy, is the
most callously brutal figure in literature. One need not
labour the proof; his treatment of Deianira, of Iole, of
Hyllus, of Lichas, of every one whom he meets,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> is
enough. The poet has taken the only possible course
to make us witness the hero’s pangs at the close with a
certain satisfaction. But the other possible theory does
away with this sham “tragedy”. Heracles as a coarse
stupid “man of action” who is yet capable of reflection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
and a touch of “the melting mood” shown by his giving
Iole to Hyllus when the secret of his wife’s heart is at
last irresistibly pressed upon him, is dramatic indeed.</p>

<p>But the glory of this work is Deianira. A comparison
of the <i>Trachiniæ</i> with the <i>Ajax</i> illustrates the development
of ideas in the poet’s mind. Tecmessa’s character
and position have been analysed, and we find, instead of
one woman, two—Iole and Deianira. Iole is mute; it
is not her conduct, but her involuntary influence, which
contributes to the tragedy. In Deianira, however, we
meet the Trojan princess once more, older and with more
initiative—tenderer she could not be. It is this union of
gentleness with force of mind, of love and sad knowledge
of the world, which makes her character so appealing and
gracious. A smaller poet would have made her haughty
or abject, revengeful or contemptible; Sophocles has
portrayed a noble lady, who will bend, but not kneel.
Her interview with Iole and the later conversations in
which first she excuses her husband and then on reflection
finds that she cannot share his home with the newcomer—these
scenes, painted with quiet mastery, are
the greatest work of Sophocles in the portraiture of
women.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the <i>Trachiniæ</i> is the
work of Sophocles; considerations of style, hard to describe
but overwhelming, settle the case beyond dispute.
None the less we cannot ignore the influence of
another school of drama—the Euripidean. The features
more or less certainly due to this influence are: (i) The
subject itself. Sophocles has studied a woman’s love
and its possibilities of unintended mischief in a way
which recalls many plots<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> of Euripides. (ii) The “prologue,”
especially the explanatory speech of Deianira, is
not in the usual manner of the playwright, but quite in
that of Euripides. (iii) The last lines, with their reproach
against the hardness of the gods who neglect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
their children, and the total silence about the deification
of Heracles, which was the most familiar fact of
this story, a silence emphatic throughout, are in spirit
Euripidean. (iv) The chorus is almost negligible as
a dramatic factor, and one of its songs—the first
stasimon—is literally “commonplace”; it would fit
any kind of joyous occasion. (v) The turns of expression
occasionally recall those of the younger poet. The
colloquial ποίαν δόκησιν<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> cannot be paralleled in tragedy
except in his work. One line<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> seems borrowed almost
without change. Deianira’s homely, almost coarse,
words, “and now we two await his embrace beneath
one rug,” are not what one expects from the stately
Sophocles. The prosaic φαρμακεύς<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> and the allusion<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
to Heracles’ unheroic side (ἡνίκ’ ἦν ᾠνωμένος, “when he
was deep in wine”) are on the same level. But most
Euripidean of all is the description<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Deianira gives of
her dreadful suitor. There is nothing unlike Sophocles
in this acceptance of the legend that Deianira was
wooed by a river-god. But the studied nonchalance of
the first line “my suitor was a river, Acheloüs that is,”
and the absurdity of the second, in which the divine
wooer is represented as applying (with a punctilio
strange to river-gods of legend) to the lady’s father for
her hand, and “calling” (φοιτῶν) on different occasions
as a different animal—all this mixture of horror and
comedy is absolute Euripides. The fact appears to be
that Sophocles deliberately took up the attitude of
Euripides, for two reasons—firstly, for the sheer delight
of a strange and difficult feat of artistry; secondly, in

<p><span class="smcap">Philoctetes</span><a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> (Φιλοκτήτης) was produced in the
spring of 409 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when the poet was eighty-seven years
old, and won the first prize. The hero Philoctetes was
one of the chieftains who sailed for Troy. When the fleet
touched at Chryse, he was stung in the foot by a snake.
The wound was incurable and its noxious odour, together
with the cries of the sufferer, were so troublesome
to the Greeks that they deserted him when asleep upon
the island of Lemnos, leaving with him a little food and
clothing, and his bow and arrows, the last a legacy from
Heracles. In the tenth year of the war the Greeks
learned that Troy could only be taken by help of
Philoctetes and the weapons of Heracles. Two men
were sent to Lemnos with the purpose of bringing the
maimed warrior to Troy—Odysseus because of his craft,
Neoptolemus because he was unknown to Philoctetes.</p>

<p>The scene is a desolate spot on the island, in front
of the cliff-face in which is the cave inhabited by
Philoctetes. Neoptolemus wins the confidence of the
sufferer while Odysseus keeps in the background, though
by a subtle device of a false message he aids the plot
greatly. But when the fated weapons are secured and
Philoctetes (who supposes he is to be conveyed back to
Greece) is ready to accompany Neoptolemus, the latter
tells him the truth. Philoctetes’ misery, rage, and reproaches
induce the youth to restore the weapons despite
Odysseus’ opposition, and to promise Philoctetes
a passage home. But at the last moment Heracles
appears in glory above their heads and commands
Philoctetes to proceed Troywards. He willingly consents,
and bids farewell to the scene of his long sorrow.</p>

<p>In structure this play is perhaps the most interesting
extant work of Sophocles. As elsewhere, we find a
great simple character of vast will-power exposed to a
strong temptation—Philoctetes confronted by the chance
of healing, happiness, and glory, if only he will meet in
friendship men whom he is determined to hate. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
for once there is a secondary interest which is not purely
secondary. Many will even find the development of
Neoptolemus more impressive than the situation of
Philoctetes. While the latter shows the heroic character
as it appears after the experience of life, strong, reflective,
sad, a little fierce if not soured, the other is the
hero before such experience, eager and noble but too
responsive to suggestion. Neoptolemus has just begun
life, and his first task is to betray—for the public good,
no doubt, but still to betray—a noble stranger who
merits not only respect but instant pity and tendance.
“Oh! that never had I left Scyros!” he exclaims. Life
after all is not a blaze of glorious war as his father
Achilles found it, but a sordid affair of necessary compromises.
One of the most charming things in the
drama is the clearness with which Philoctetes, in the
midst of his rage, sees the tragedy of his youthful captor.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
Confronted by the kindness of the youth, he reveals
himself not as a mere savage, living only on thoughts of
revenge; he becomes more flexible, open-hearted, almost
sociable. So revealed, he is the direct cause of the
change in Neoptolemus’ purpose.</p>

<p>Beside these stands Odysseus, only less striking and
equally indispensable. For a chief note of this drama
is the skill with which the poet avails himself of the three
actors, whose possibilities are here for perhaps the first
time fully employed. It is easy, but mistaken, to label
Odysseus as “the villain”. In reality he is the State
personified. There is no modern reader who does not
hate and contemn him, but it remains true that whereas
Philoctetes whom we pity and Neoptolemus whom we
love both take a strictly personal view, Odysseus at the
risk of his life insists on pressing the claim of the community.
It is necessary to Greece that Troy should fall.
She can only fall through the arrows of Heracles. The
man who owns them will assuredly not consent. It
follows that he must be compelled to help, by force or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
guile. A conquering nation must have its Philip as well
as its Alexander; Odysseus stands for facts which
twenty years of the Peloponnesian war had driven home
into Athenian minds. Neoptolemus is the type of many
a young warrior who has learned with aching disgust
that the knightly exploits which tales of Marathon had
fired him to perform must be thwarted unceasingly by
the politic meanderings of Nicias, by considerations of
corn-supply, or the “representations” of some remote
satrap.</p>

<p>And in the end Odysseus gets his way. As the two
friends start for home, leaving the Greeks at Troy to
defeat and the oracles of Heaven to non-fulfilment, a
god appears to command from the sky that self-sacrifice
shall be revoked and hate forgotten. What are we to
think of this intervention of Heracles? Is he not an
extreme instance of the <i>deus ex machina</i>? Is not mere
compulsion employed to change a settled resolve?
This is the most striking and the most difficult feature
of the construction: rather it seems the negation of
structure. Why is it employed? Some<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> have been
content to suggest Euripidean influence—of course no
answer at all. Some<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> have thought that Heracles is
personified conscience, rising to remind Philoctetes of
his duty to Greece; a suggestion ruled out by the fact
that his duty has been urged clearly by Neoptolemus.
A more attractive idea<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> is that the genuine <i>peripeteia</i> of
the play consists in Neoptolemus’ change of front; in
this way an inner dramatic unity is secured, while the
external change induced by Heracles is a mere concession
to the data of legend. This in its turn is vitiated
by the fact that for the dramatist Philoctetes, and not
Neoptolemus, is the central figure: this is proved by
the work as a whole and by the title which the poet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
himself gave it. If the <i>deus ex machina</i> is not to be
condemned utterly, it follows from the basic law of Attic
art that the play up to the moment of Heracles’ appearance,
however complete it seemed to us a moment ago,
is not complete—that some coping-stone is still needed.
And if we consider the action up to that point we cannot
really be content. To disregard the oracles which
tradition said were fulfilled, the action, as Sophocles
depicts it, is unsatisfactory. Philoctetes is to get the
revenge which seems rightly his, and we approve his
young companion who aids him at such cost. But by
this time we feel a little dubious about the sufferer.
There has been perhaps too much detail in his outcries
and his account of his sufferings. Hatred which will
refuse both health and fame, without any loss but that
of aged intentions, has begun to seem a moral falsetto.
But who can say, without misgiving, that (on pagan
principles) he is wrong? One person only in Heaven
and earth—Heracles. Every ordinary consideration
of public and personal interest has been put before
Philoctetes in vain. But there is another thought which
neither the victim himself nor Odysseus nor Neoptolemus
has strength enough to suggest, or even to remember.
One character alone in Greek story rises above the conception
of personal injury or personal benefit as a motive
to action; Heracles is the great reminder, not so much
that wrongs to oneself should be forgiven, as that life
is too short and precious to be wasted on revenge.
Heracles would return a blow with vigour, but a vendetta,
in the light of his career, seems a childish folly.
One does not forget that some pictures of his character
(that, for instance, in the <i>Trachiniæ</i>) belie this conception;
but Sophocles here sees fit to choose a different,
and the more usual, view. Suddenly the husk of selfish
spite falls away from the sufferer’s soul. He who has
just promised<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> to use the weapons of Heracles in a
private quarrel and has already attempted<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> so to use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
them, at last remembers that they are the rightful instrument
of well-doing, and that it was for such a reason<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
that he received them from the hero at his passing into
glory. Heracles then is introduced as the only person
who can press upon Philoctetes an argument which the
cunning of Odysseus and the candour of Neoptolemus
have alike ignored. That he appears as a <i>deus ex
machina</i> is in part accident—he is not selected by the
poet for that reason. But it is a happy accident, for the
glory which envelops him is the visible warrant of his
inspiring behests—anything rather than the sign of
overwhelming might summoned to break a reasonable
human resolve. Thus the close of this play is a real
ending, not a breakdown; it is the pagan analogue of
the <i>Quo Vadis</i> legend.</p>

<p>The whole play is an example of intrigue. The
episode of the pseudo-merchant<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> is the most brilliant
feat of Sophocles in this department. It reveals to
Philoctetes that he is being pursued by the Greeks,
without arousing his suspicion of Neoptolemus, and
so gives occasion for the transfer of the bow when
the sufferer’s fit seizes him; it conveys a strong reminder
of urgency to Neoptolemus; and it enables Odysseus
to learn how his plot progresses. Odysseus merely
by telling of his promise to capture Philoctetes is in
a fair way to fulfil it, as it throws his prey into the arms
of Neoptolemus. One apparent fault of construction
is of a type which we have already noted. It is vital
that Philoctetes, before his first consent to leave the
island, should know his friend’s real purpose of taking
him to Troy. But why is he told of it? The merest
beginner in duplicity would surely postpone such a
revelation until the victim was at sea. But Sophocles
chooses to tighten his plot up in order to give the
situation in one picture.</p>

<p>Dio Chrysostom in one of his most valuable essays<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
sets up a comparison between the plays on Philoctetes
composed by the three tragedians. The work of
Sophocles is the latest, and two peculiarities help us to
see how far his originality went. Firstly, as a companion
to Odysseus he introduces, not Diomedes as
Euripides had done, but a figure new to the Trojan
war, an ingenuous lad whose sympathy brings out what
gentleness remains in the sufferer’s heart. Secondly,
the chorus consists of Greek sailors, not of Lemnian
natives as in the two other playwrights. Sophocles
will have no Lemnian visitors because for him it is
a cardinal fact that Philoctetes all these years has been
alone save for a chance ship. Thus we gain for a
moment a glance into the actual thoughts of Sophocles:
he has made up his mind that his Philoctetes must be
quite solitary. So essential is this that he falsifies
known facts. Lemnos, he says in the second line of
his play, is “untrodden, uninhabited by men,” whereas,
both in the times supposed and in the poet’s own day,
it was a populous place. This, then, gives an invaluable
indication of the extent to which Sophocles
felt himself free to re-model his subject-matter. On
the play itself it throws light. The question is to be
studied not from the point of view of the Greek army,
but from that of their potential helper, soured as he
is by a more extreme suffering than Æschylus and
Euripides had imagined.</p>

<p>The picture thus conceived is painted with splendid
power. Romantic desolation makes itself felt in the
opening words of Odysseus, and this sense of the
frowning grandeur of nature to which Philoctetes in
his despair appeals<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> is everywhere associated with the
pathos of lonely suffering. “While the mountain
nymph, babbling Echo, appearing afar, makes answer
to his bitter cries.”<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> All that he says, from his first
exclamation of joy at hearing again the Greek language
to the noble speech in which he bids farewell to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
bitter home which use has made something like a friend,
is instinct with this mingling of romance and pathos.
Deserted by all men he has yet found companions
whom in his misery he addresses; his hands, his
poisoned foot, his eyes, his bow, and the familiar landscape,
vocal with the “bass roar of the sea upon the
headland”.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Closer even than these is his eternal
unseen companion, Pain, whom he found at his side
on first awakening after the departure of the Greek
host: “When my scrutiny had traversed all the land,
no inhabitant could I find therein save Sorrow; and that,
my son, could be met at every turn”.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>It has been suspected that the play contains allusions
to contemporary politics, that the poet is thinking of
Alcibiades’ return from exile. In 410—the year before
this play was produced—he had gained credit from the
naval victory of Cyzicus. Some, moreover, have seen
in Odysseus the cynical politician of the day. Other
passages read like criticism of the public “atmosphere”
at Athens in the closing years of the great war. The
dramatist is making deliberate comments on contemporary
Athenian politics, but he assuredly did
not choose the whole theme of Philoctetes merely
because of Alcibiades’ restoration.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Œdipus Coloneus</span><a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> (Οἰδίπους ἐπὶ Κολωνῷ) or
<i>Œdipus at Colonus</i> was according to the customary
view produced in 401 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, three years after the poet’s
death, by his namesake and grandson. The background<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
represents the grove of the Furies at Colonus, a village
near Athens. Œdipus, exiled from Thebes, an aged
blind wanderer, enters led by his daughter Antigone.
They obtain the favour of King Theseus and the citizens,
Œdipus promising that after his death his spirit shall
defend Athens. Ismene, his daughter, brings news that
an oracle has said that in the struggle between Thebes
and the Seven led by Polynices, son of Œdipus, that
side shall win which has possession of Œdipus. Both
parties are now eager for his support, but he curses both
his sons. Creon, King of Thebes, enters, and failing to
gain aught but reproaches, carries off the two girls, and
is about to seize the father also when he is checked by
the arrival of Theseus, who rescues the maidens. Polynices
next comes to beg his father’s aid, but is sent to his
doom with curses. Then a peal of thunder announces to
Œdipus that the moment of his passing is at hand. He
bids farewell to his daughters, and, watched only by
Theseus, descends to the underworld; the place of his
burial is to be known to none save Theseus and his successors.
Ismene and Antigone in vain beg to be shown
the spot, and finally Antigone resolves to seek Thebes
that she may reconcile her brothers.</p>

<p>This play is simple in structure, superbly rich in
execution. Œdipus dominates all the scenes, which
reveal with piercing intensity his physical helplessness
and the spiritual might which, marked at the opening, is
overwhelming at the close. The poet’s task is not
merely to portray the last hours of a much-tried man,
but the novitiate of a superhuman Power. Œdipus at
last reaches peace and a welcome from the infernal gods—he
becomes a δαίμων. The terrific feature is that even
in the flesh he anticipates his dæmonic qualities. In the
interview between him and Polynices, the implacable
hatred, the strength, the prophetic sight of the father,
and the hopeless prayers, the wretchedness, the despair
and moral collapse of the doomed son, are nothing but
the presentation in human life of the actual dæmon’s
power as prophesied for future generations. Before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
close we feel that the aged exile’s sufferings, sombre
wisdom, and simple burning emotions have already
made him a being of unearthly powers, sundered from
normal humanity; his strange passing is but the ratification
of a spiritual fact already accomplished. But this
weird climax is preceded by an equally wonderful study
of the human Œdipus. The king who appears in the
<i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i> can here still be recognized. Passionate
anger still directs much of his conduct, as friend
and foe alike remind<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> him. But even his faults are
mellowed by years and contemplation; his very anger
shows some gleam of a profounder patience. Throughout,
the temper of Œdipus is like that of the heavens
above him—gloom cleft by flashes of insight, indignation,
and love. Unlike other aged sufferers, he does not dwell
in the past; unlike the saint and martyr whom a Christian
dramatist might have portrayed, he does not lean upon
a future of glory or happiness. Nor again has he sunk
into a senile acquiescence in the present; he is far from
being absorbed by the loving tendance of his daughters.
The centre of his life has shifted, but not to any period
of time—rather to another plane of being. Still in the
flesh, his human emotions as essential as ever, his life
is growing assimilated to the non-human existence of
the whole earth. And so it is that Œdipus meets
“death” with cheerfulness; he is departing to his own
place. At the last moment the blind man leads those
who see to the place of his departure. What to them
is dreadful and secret is to him the centre of his longing;
the terrific figures who inhabit his new home are welcome
friends—at the beginning of the play he addresses the
Furies themselves as “<i>sweet</i> daughters of primeval
Night”.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> The whole drama at the end is full of this
sense. In the farewell song of the chorus which commends
the wanderer to the powers of Earth, there is an
eerie precision and picturesqueness in the description of
the lower world; the “infernal moor”<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> and the guardian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
hound gleam forth for an instant into strange familiarity.</p>

<p>The other characters are carved, though in lower
relief, yet with richness and vigour. Theseus is the
ideal Athenian gentleman,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> suddenly called to show
pity to a pair of helpless wanderers, then unexpectedly
involved in battle with a neighbour state, and finally
confronted with the most awful mysteries of divine
government, without ever losing his courage or his
discretion. Creon and Polynices, such is the immense
understanding of the aged poet, share too in this nobility
of mind. They can face facts; and whether villains or
not, they are men of breeding. The “stranger” who
first accosts Œdipus is a charming embodiment of that
local patriotism to which we shall return in a moment.
The two sisters are beautifully distinguished by the
divergent experiences of years. Antigone’s wandering
and hardship have made her the more intense and
passionate; Ismene’s life in Thebes have given her
comprehension of more immediate issues. It is through
Antigone, moreover, who declares that she will seek
Thebes and attempt to save her brothers, that the poet
obtains one of his noblest effects. Overwhelming as is
the story of Œdipus, his end does not close all; life
goes on to further mysteries of pain and affection.</p>

<p>On the purely literary side the <i>Œdipus Coloneus</i>
is certainly the greatest and the most typical work
of Sophocles. The most celebrated lyric in Greek is
the splendid ode in praise of Colonus—“our white
Colonus; where the nightingale, a constant guest, trills
her clear note in the covert of green glades, dwelling
amid the wine-dark ivy and the god’s inviolate bowers,
rich in berries and fruit, unvisited by sun, unvexed by
wind of any storm; where the reveller Dionysus ever
walks the ground, companion of the nymphs that nursed
him,”<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>—and of the whole land with its peculiar glories,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
the olive of peace and the steed of war. To this should
be added that address of Œdipus to Theseus concerning
the fickleness of all things earthly which is less the
speech of one man than the voice of Life itself.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Noblest
of all is the account of Œdipus’ last moments, a passage
which in breathless loveliness, pathos, and religious profundity
is beyond telling flawless and without peer. It
is curious that Sophocles in this work which, more than
any other, reveals his own poetic mastery should have
definitely drawn attention to the power of language.
At various crises in the play he speaks of the “little
word”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> and its potency. Œdipus reflects how his two
sons for lack of a “little word” in his defence have
suffered him to be thrust forth into exile; the nobility
of Theseus, the sudden hostility of Thebes in days to
come, the appearance of Polynices, are all matters of
the “little word” which means so much. And in his
marvellous farewell to his daughters, Œdipus speaks
of the “one word” which has made all his sorrows
vanish—“love”.</p>

<p>Every master-work of literature has a prophetic
quality, and sending its roots down near to the deepest
wells of life is instinct with unconscious kinships. The
<i>Œdipus Coloneus</i> is rich in this final glory of art. The
whole conception of the sufferer, aged and blind but
gifted with spiritual sight, recalls the blind Milton’s sublime
address to the Light which “shines inward”; and
the thought adds charm to Sophocles’ description of the
nightingale<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> which</p>

passing of another august soul: “No man knoweth of

<p>This play is deeply religious in the very details of
its theme as well as in its tone. Besides the usual
orthodox background there is the lovely presentation of
a minor local worship—the cult of the Eumenides
at Colonus, Sophocles’ native village. The aged poet
in his last years seems to have returned with special
affection to the simple observances which he had learnt
as a boy, and which evoke one of his most characteristic
phrases:—<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">the piercing simplicity of which, as well as the theme,
suggests Wordsworth. The lustral bowls, he is careful
to tell us, are “the work of a skilled craftsman”;<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> he is
almost on the point of telling us his name—one can
imagine the boy of eighty years ago gazing on these cups,

ground is both familiar and hallowed; the mysterious
“brazen threshold,” the statues of local deities and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
heroes, the hollow pear-tree, and the other local sanctities
are carefully particularized, so that the calm beauty of
the country-side and the terrors of religion are strangely
and beautifully interwoven. As for religion in the
broader, profounder sense, we have as elsewhere a
reference of human suffering merely to an inscrutable,
divine purpose.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> But the dramatist indicates carefully
the contribution of human nature to the fulfilment of the
oracles; Polynices<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> becomes subject to his father’s curse
because his own sense of honour forbids him to relinquish
his foredoomed enterprise. Œdipus himself has attained
to a wiser conception of sin<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> than that which
rules him at the close of the <i>Tyrannus</i>. He has acted
wrongly, therefore his suffering is just; but he is morally
innocent, and his past actions afflict him as sorrows, not
as crimes.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p class="tb">The fragments of the lost plays are on the whole
disappointing; a large proportion are single rare words
quoted by ancient lexicographers, and most of the rest are
short sentences or phrases. There remain the few longer
fragments, to which in recent years important additions
have been made.</p>

<p>It seems that the <i>Triptolemus</i> was his first play,
produced in 468 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> when the poet was twenty-eight.
It would then be one of the works with which he won
his victory<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> over Æschylus, and it bore marks of the
older writer’s influence. The theme is the mission of
Triptolemus, who traversed the earth distributing to
men corn, the gift of Demeter, and founded the mysteries
at Eleusis. This topic gave room for a long geographical
passage which recalls those of the <i>Prometheus</i>. Other
early dramas were the <i>Thamyras</i> in which the dramatist
himself took the name-part and played the cithara, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
the <i>Nausicaa</i> or <i>Women Washing</i> wherein Sophocles
acted the part of that princess and gained applause by
his skill in a game of ball. The satyric drama <i>Amphiaraus</i>
contained a curious scene wherein an illiterate
man conveyed some name or other word to his hearers
by a dance in which his contortions represented successive
letters. Another satyric play <i>The Mustering of
the Greeks</i> (Ἀχαιῶν Σύλλογος) or the <i>Dinner-Party</i>
(Σύνδειπνοι) earned the reprobation of Cicero<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> apparently
for its coarseness, which can still be noted in the fragments.
In <i>The Lovers of Achilles</i> (Ἀχιλλέως ἐρασταί)
there was a passage describing the perplexity of passion,
which in its mannered felicity recalls Swinburne or the
Sonnets of Shakespeare:—</p>

<p class="noindent">The <i>Laocoon</i>, which dealt with a famous episode in the
capture of Troy, supplies a fragment describing Æneas’
escape from the city with his father upon his shoulders;

fable of the Thracian King Tereus, his wife Procne,
and her sister Philomela, all of whom were at last
changed into birds. Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> has an obscure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>

<p>In 1907 there came to light at Oxyrhynchus in
Egypt considerable fragments<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> of two Sophoclean
dramas.</p>

<p>Most of these once formed part of the <i>Ichneutæ</i>
(Ἰχνευταί) or <i>Detectives</i>. Formerly we had only two
brief and obscure fragments, and one word quoted by
Athenæus; it was known that the play was satyric.
The theme was quite uncertain; and conjecture<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> is now
shown to have gone quite astray. Sophocles, we find,
has dramatized the myth so admirably treated in the
Homeric <i>Hymn to Hermes</i>. A considerable portion of
the work can now be read. The god Apollo announces
that his cattle have been stolen and that he cannot trace
them; he offers a reward to anyone who catches the
thief. Silenus and the chorus of satyrs undertake the
quest; they are the “trackers” from whom the play is
named. After a time they spy the footprints of oxen
and exclaim that “some god is leading the colony”. A
noise<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> which they cannot understand is heard behind the
scenes. The numerous tracks now give them trouble;
they point backwards here and there—“an odd confusion
must have possessed the herdsman!” Next the satyrs
fall on their faces, to the amazement of Silenus who
likens this “trick of hunting on your stomach” to the
position of “a hedgehog in a bush”. They bid him
listen; he importantly replies that they are not helping
“my investigation,” loses his temper, and roundly reviles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
their cowardice. They recover themselves and soon
arrive at a cave. Silenus kicks at the door until the
nymph Cyllene comes forth. She protests against their
boisterous behaviour, but is appeased by their apologies.
When they ask the meaning of the strange sound,
Cyllene reports the birth of the god Hermes whom she
is tending within, and his amazingly rapid growth. The
noise is produced by the babe from “a vessel filled with
pleasure made from a dead beast”. The “detectives”
are still perplexed; what is this creature? The goddess
describes the creature in riddling language. They make
laughably divergent guesses: a cat, a panther, a lizard,
a crab, a big-horned beetle; and at last they are told that
the beast is a tortoise. She describes the delight<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> which
the child draws from his playing. The satyrs inform
Cyllene that her nursling is the thief; she indignantly
denies that a son of Zeus can have so acted, and takes
the accusation as a joke. They vigorously repeat their
charge, and begin to quarrel with Cyllene. From this
point onwards practically nothing can be made of the
papyrus-scraps, except that Apollo re-appears, and
seems to be giving the “detectives” their reward.</p>

<p>The papyrus which contained the other play, the
<i>Eurypylus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> is in tiny fragments, but some of these,
combined with our independent knowledge of the story,
enable us to give an outline of the plot. Astyoche,
mother of Eurypylus, was induced by Priam to allow her
son to help the Trojans against the Greeks. He met
Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, in battle and was slain.
A messenger related the encounter to (it seems) his
mother Astyoche. The body was received by Priam
with lamentation as if for a son of his own. This fragment
is much the most striking of the collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>Sophocles’ position in literary history has already
been indicated.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> We shall here discuss his mind and his
art in general outline. Of his political opinions little is
known. Though his work abounds in saws of statecraft,
these are of quite general application;<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and it
would be dangerous to declare which side, if any, he
took in the political crises which were so numerous and
so grave in fifth-century Athens; there is perhaps one
hint<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> that he did not approve the ascendancy of Pericles.
As for religion, he seems to have accepted both the
orthodox cults of his country and the current beliefs of
the ordinary Athenian with little reserve or none. This
brings us at once to a fact which must not be ignored—the
feeling among readers of our own day, that Sophocles
for all his merits is a little too complacent, too urbane,
lacking somehow in profundity and real grip upon the
soul. The answer is that we come to Sophocles pre-occupied
by the religious questionings which fill our own
time and which, moreover, interest both Æschylus and
Euripides; but there is no reason why Sophocles should
share our disquiet or that of his fellow-craftsmen. That
which for Æschylus is the foreground of his work, forms
for Sophocles only the background. He is not especially
interested in religion itself, but in humanity. For
Æschylus religion is an affair of the intellect; for
Euripides it is an affair of morals; for Sophocles it belongs
to the sphere of emotion. And the two great
instruments with which he constructs his plays are
human emotions and human will. For all the plays
which we possess the same genesis exists: the chief
character experiences some mighty appeal to the emotions—the
feeling of self-respect in Ajax and Œdipus
at Athens, of family love in Antigone and Electra, of revengefulness
in Philoctetes, of wifely dignity and affection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
in Deianira, of pity in Œdipus at Thebes; and then
creates drama by the magnificent pathetic staunchness
wherewith the will, taking its direction from the emotion
so aroused, presses on ruthlessly in its attempt to satisfy
this impulse. Nothing seems so dear to him as a purpose
which flaunts cold reason, the purpose of any others,
and indeed every other emotion save that which has
started the action upon its course. He sets before us a
person determined on some striking act, and subjects him
to all conceivable assaults of reason and preachments
on expediency, showing him unbroken throughout. The
onslaughts upon Ajax, Antigone, Philoctetes, Œdipus,
are not mere stage-rhetoric; they are “sound common-sense,”
“appeals to one’s better self”; and no logical
denial can be opposed to them. Only one power in man
is able to withstand them—the will, taking its stand once
for all upon some instinct for clear, simple action. If
we never listen to reason we are lost; but if we always
listen we are lost equally. That these heroes of the
will so often come to misery or death matters little; they
have saved their souls alive instead of sinking themselves
in a sordid acceptance of a second-hand morality. Over
against these figures, to emphasize their defiant grandeur,
the poet loves to set persons admirable indeed, but more
commonplace, who emerge in the dread hour when the
haughty will has brought ruin, and approve themselves
as the pivot of the situation. The hero is great and
strikes the imagination, but it is on the shoulders of men
like Creon in the <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>, Odysseus, Hyllus,
Theseus in the <i>Œdipus Coloneus</i>, that the real burden of
the world’s work may be safely cast. None the less he
loves Antigone better than he loves Ismene, Œdipus
rather than Theseus. In one place at least, in his dislike
for the “reasonable” spirit of compromise, he suffers
himself a malicious little <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. When
Chrysothemis finds Electra uttering her resentment at
the palace gate she says:—<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>I must in all things bend to those in power.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As for the plots themselves, their main feature is
that deliberate complexity which we have called intrigue
and which was made possible by the poet’s use of a
third actor. After the great achievements of Æschylus
it became necessary to add some fresh kind of interest;
this Euripides found in a readjustment of sympathies,
Sophocles in an increase of dramatic thrill. It is an
exciting moment in the <i>Trachiniæ</i> when, just as
Deianira is about to re-enter the palace, the messenger
mysteriously draws her apart and reveals the
truth about the captive Iole. The magnificent death-scene
of Ajax is the outcome of the cunning wherewith
he has thrown his friends off the scent. The <i>Electra</i>
is full of this method; the mission of Chrysothemis is
turned into a weapon against the murderess who sent
her, and the episode of Orestes’ funeral-urn is a magnificent
piece of dramatic artistry. In the <i>Œdipus
Tyrannus</i> the king brings about his own fatal illumination
by sending for the herdsman. The <i>Philoctetes</i>,
above all, is filled with the deliberate plotting of
Odysseus. The marked increase in complexity which
Sophocles’ work thus shows as compared with that
of Æschylus is undoubtedly the chief (perhaps the
only) reason for his desertion of the trilogy form.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Side
by side with this attention to mechanism is that curious
indifference to the fringes of the plot which we have
had occasion to notice in several places.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of Sophocles is that famous
“tragic irony” by which again he imparts new power
to old themes. It turns to magnificent profit a circumstance
which might seem to vitiate dramatic interest—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
fact that the spectator knows the myth and
therefore cannot be taken by surprise. Between an
audience which foresees the event, and the stage-personages
who cannot, the playwright sets up a
thrilling interest of suspense. He causes his characters
to discuss the future they expect in language which
is fearfully and exquisitely suitable to the future which
actually awaits them. Ajax, while his madness still
afflicts him, stands amid the slaughtered cattle and
proclaims his triumph over the Greek chieftains, just
before he awakes to the truth that by his “triumph”
he has ruined himself. More elaborate is the scene
in which Deianira explains her stratagem of the robe
which is to bring back the love of Heracles. But the
<i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i> provides by far the finest instance.
As the king in scene after scene accumulates horror
upon his own unconscious head, the spectator receives,
always at the right moment and in full measure, the
impact of increasing disaster. Yet since his perception
is a discovery which he himself has made, horror is
tempered by an intellectual glow, a spiritual exaltation.</p>

<p>In the art of iambic verse Sophocles stands beyond
all other Greeks unrivalled. Beside him Æschylus
sounds almost clumsy, Euripides glib, Aristophanes
vulgar. Only Shakespeare has that complete mastery
over every shade of emphasis, every possibility of
grandeur and simple ease alike. The iambic line in
Sophocles’ hands can at will display a haunting romantic
loveliness, the profoundest dignity, the sharpest edges
of emotion, or the quiet prose of every day. Consider
the following lines,<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> which begin near the end of Electra’s
long speech of complaint to the chorus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">ΗΛ. ὡς νῦν ἀπόντος ἱστόρει τί σοι φίλον.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Electra’s speech is solemn poetry. The large number
of spondees<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> (there are three in the last line), the slow
elaboration of the ideas—an elaboration admirably
pointed by τοι, which brings the rhythm almost to a
standstill—make a strong contrast with the following
conversation. There the relaxation of the rhythm is
unmistakable; φέρ’ εἰπέ is almost casual in its lightness,
and it is at once followed by a tribrach. The rather
odd use of the bare dative ἀγροῖσι is a delightfully neat
tinge of colloquialism, supported by τυγχάνει. The
<i>Philoctetes</i> will repay special study from this point of
view. There is a remarkable tendency to divide<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> lines
between speakers in order to express excitement; this
device is elsewhere very uncommon. From this play
we may select one example<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> of amazing skill in rhythm.
Philoctetes is explaining how he contrives to crawl to
and fro in quest of food and the like:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">γαστρὶ μὲν τὰ σύμφορα</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τόξον τόδ’ ἐξηύρισκε, τὰς ὑποπτέρους</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">βάλλον πελείας· πρὸς δὲ τοῦθ’, ὅ μοι βάλοι</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">νευροσπαδὴς ἄτρακτος, αὐτὸς ἂν τάλας</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">εἰλυόμην δύστηνος ἐξέλκων πόδα</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">πρὸς τοῦτ’ ἄν.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The dull repetition of πρὸς τοῦτο and of ἄν; the extremely
slow movement of the penultimate line with
its three spondees and the word-ending at the close
of the second foot; above all, the manner in which the
whole dragging sentence leads up to the monosyllable
ἄν, so rare at the end of a sentence, and there stops
dead, is a marvellous suggestion of the lame man’s
painful progress and of the way in which at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
his endurance he falls prone and spent upon the object
of his endeavour.</p>

<p>Specially striking phrases are not common. Sophocles
obtains his effect not by brilliant strokes of
diction, but by the cumulative effect of a sustained
manner. There are such dexterities of course, like
Antigone’s πόθος τοι καὶ κακῶν ἄρ’ ἦν τις,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> and the cry
of Electra to her brother’s ashes:—<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">τοίγαρ σὺ δέξαι μ’ ἐς τὸ σὸν τόδε στέγος</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τὴν μηδὲν εἰς τὸ μηδέν.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A poet who can, by that infinitesimal change from τὸν
μηδέν to τὸ μηδέν, indicate the very soul of grief, may
claim to be one of the immortal masters of language.</p>

<p>Modern readers find one great fault in this poet—colourlessness,
coldness, an absence of hearty verve; he
seems a little too polished and restrained. The truth is
that in Sophocles the Attic spirit finds its literary
culmination. Æschylus lives in the pre-Periclean
world; Euripides is too restless and cosmopolitan to
reflect the spirit of one nation only; Plato and Demosthenes
belong to the age of disillusionment which came
after Ægospotami; and Thucydides, though he shows
many Attic qualities, is without limpidity. Anyone,
then, who would understand the Athenian genius as
embodied in letters must read Sophocles. He will find
the most useful commentary in the Parthenon and its
friezes, and in the remains of Greek statuary. One of
the most marvellous and precious experiences in life is
to gaze upon works like the so-called Fates in the
British Museum, the Venus of Melos, or the Ludovisi
Hera. Many a casual visitor has glanced for the first
time at these works and known strong disappointment.
A mere piece of marble accurately worked into a female
face or figure; majestic to be sure—but is this all? If
he will look again he at last perceives that the stone
has put on, not merely humanity, but immortality. An<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
invisible glow radiates from it like the odour from a
flower. We have never found any name for it but
Beauty. It is indeed the quintessence of loveliness,
delicate as gossamer yet indestructible as granite. So
with the tragedies of Sophocles: it is possible to read
the <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i> in certain moods and find it
mere frigid elegance. But, as with the beauties of
Nature, so with the glories of art, it is the second glance,
the lingering of the eye beyond the careless moment,
that surprises something of the ultimate secret.</p>

<p>For reticence is one of the notes of Athenian art.
No writer ever effected so much with so scanty materials
as Sophocles; he carries the art of masterly omission to
its extreme. Shakespeare attempts to express everything;
the mere exuberance of his phraseology is as
wonderful as anything else in his work. But even <i>King
Lear</i> or <i>Hamlet</i>, being written by a man, share the
weakness of humanity and leave the foundation of life
undisclosed. Such a disability may daunt the scientist;
it is the salvation of the artist; for the effect of all art
rests on co-operation between the maker and the spectator
of the work. In literature, then, the author knows that
he must omit, and the reader or hearer must supply for
himself the contributions of his own heart and experience.
How much then is he to omit? On the varying answers
to that question rest the different forms of literature and
the divergent schools of each form. Sophocles has left
more to his hearer than any other writer in the world.
Another note of Athenian art is simplicity. It is not
crudeness, nor <i>naïveté</i>, nor baldness of style. In a
thousand passages of Sophocles, Thucydides, and Plato,
the line between savourless banality and the words they
have written is fine indeed, but that little means a
whole world of art. Many a fine author—Marlowe is a
conspicuous example—writes nobly because he writes
violently, or with a conscious effort to soar. But let him
once trip, and he sprawls in bombast or nerveless
garrulity. Simplicity without baldness is the most
difficult of all literary excellences, and is yet achieved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
everywhere by Sophocles except when he rises to a
different level, of which we shall speak later.</p>

<p>Such then is the cause of Sophoclean frigidity and
lack of colour. He is led to write so by his Attic
frugality and economy of effect, by his knowledge that
his audience can follow him into his rarefied atmosphere,
and by another cause. In our own time men have
looked to art for a “message” from more exciting or
more lovely spheres. We talk of “the literature of
escape”; for us art must be an expanding influence.
The Athenian sought in it a concentrating influence.
Each citizen who witnessed the <i>Antigone</i> was a member
of a sovereign assembly; he understood foreign policy
at first hand; war or peace depended upon his voice.
Many came to watch the <i>Ajax</i> who had but a while ago
fought at Œnophyta or in Egypt. Such men did not
need “local colour” and exciting technicalities. Their
own lives were full of great events. What they asked
of art was serenity, profundity, to blend their own
scattered experiences into one noble picture of life itself,
life made beautiful because so wonderfully comprehended.
This was the function of Sophocles and his brother-craftsmen.</p>

<p>Beyond the normal lucid beauty of lyrics and dialogue,
and beyond the frequent outpourings of splendid
eloquence in long speeches, there is a still higher level
of poetry which should be noted. Now and again his
pages are filled with an unearthly splendour. Reference
has been made before to certain isolated lines which
combine utter simplicity with bewildering charm.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> But
here and there the poet has given us whole speeches in
this divine manner. They are always a comment on
the matter in hand, but they are conceived in the spirit
of one who “contemplates all time and all existence,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
who stands apart from man and sees him in his place
amid the workings of the universe. One of these
ethereal utterances is the speech<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> of Œdipus to Theseus
who has expressed his doubt whether Thebes will ever
desert the friendship of Athens; it begins:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fair Aigeus’ son, only to gods in heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comes no old age nor death of anything;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All else is turmoiled by our master Time.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The earth’s strength fades and manhood’s glory fades,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faith dies, and unfaith blossoms like a flower.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And who shall find in the open streets of men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or secret places of his own heart’s love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One wind blow true for ever?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">More personal, but instinct with the same glow of
imaginative beauty is the soliloquy<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> of Ajax when at
the point of death. It is in passages like these that one
realizes the value of the restraint which obtains elsewhere;
when the author gives his voice full scope the
effect is heartshaking. Ajax’ appeal to the sun-god to
“check his gold-embossed rein” fills with splendour at
a word the heavens which were lowering with horror.
It recalls Marlowe’s lines of the same type and effect
though in different application, which suffuse the agony
of Faust with bitter glory:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That time may cease, and midnight never come!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The greatest achievement of Sophocles was, however,
reserved till the close of his life. The messenger’s
speech,<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> narrating the last moments of Œdipus, is the
culmination in Greek of whatever miracles human
language can compass in exciting awe and delight.
The poet has bent all his mastery of tense idiom, of
varied and haunting rhythm, all his instinct for the
pathos of life and the mystery of fate, to produce one
mighty uplifting of the hearer into the region where
emotion and intellect are no longer opposed but mingle
into something for which we have no name but “Life”.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WORKS OF EURIPIDES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Of nearly one hundred dramas composed by
Euripides nineteen<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> have survived. These
are now discussed in the approximate chronological
order; the precise date of production is,
however, known in but few cases.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Alcestis</span><a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> (Ἄλκηστις), acted in 438 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when
the poet was already forty-two years old, is the earliest.
It formed the fourth play of a tetralogy which contained
the lost works <i>Women of Crete</i>, <i>Alcmæon at Psophis</i>,
and <i>Telephus</i>. Euripides obtained the second prize,
being vanquished by Sophocles—with what play is not
known. The scene is laid at Pheræ and presents the
palace of Admetus, King of Thessaly. The god Apollo
relates how he has induced the Fates to allow Admetus
to escape death on his destined day, if he can find
some one to die in his stead. All refused save his wife,
Alcestis, whose death therefore is to happen this very
day. Thanatos (Death) enters and Apollo in vain asks
him to spare the queen; a quarrel follows, and Apollo
departs with threats. The chorus of Pheræan elders enter
and hear, from a servant, of Alcestis’ courageous leave-takings.
Next the queen is borne forth and dies amid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
the lamentations of her husband and little son. All
save the chorus retire to prepare for the funeral, when
Heracles enters. Admetus comes forth and insists on
making the hero his guest, pretending that it is a
stranger who has died. Heracles is taken to the guest-chamber
and the elders reproach Admetus for his
unseasonable hospitality. The funeral procession is
moving forward when Pheres, father of Admetus, enters
to pay his respects to the dead. His son with cold
fury repels him: why did he, an aged man, not consent
to die, and so save Alcestis? A vigorous and coarse
altercation follows. When all have gone the butler
enters, complaining of Heracles’ drunken feasting; the
latter soon follows, and is quickly sobered by learning
the truth. He proclaims his intention of rescuing
Alcestis from Thanatos, and hurries away. Admetus
returns followed by the chorus, expressing his utter grief
and desolation. Heracles arrives with a veiled woman,
whom he says he has won as a prize at some athletic
contest; he must now depart to fulfil his next “labour”—the
capture of Diomedes’ man-eating steeds—and
requests Admetus to take care of the woman till his
return. The king reluctantly consents, and Heracles
unveils her, whereupon Admetus recognizes his wife.
She does not speak, being (as Heracles explains) for
three days yet subject to the infernal deities.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The play
ends with the joy of Admetus, a dry remark of Heracles
on true hospitality, and a few lines<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> from the chorus expressing
wonder at the mysterious ways of Heaven.</p>

<p>The Greek introductions to this play contain interesting
criticisms: “the close of the drama is somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
comic”; “the drama is more or less satyric, because it
ends in joy and pleasure”. These remarks, coupled
with the fact that the <i>Alcestis</i> (as the last play of the
tetralogy) occupied the place of the customary satyric
drama, have caused much discussion. It is enough to
say here: first, that the <i>Alcestis</i> is in no sense a satyric
play;<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> second, that it undoubtedly presents comic
features; third, that none the less the work belongs to
the sphere of tragedy. It is sometimes difficult, and
often undesirable, to label dramatic poems too definitely;
but we must certainly avoid the impression that this
play is a comedy. It deals poignantly with the most
solemn interests of humanity; the comic scenes merely
show, what is almost as obvious elsewhere, that Euripides
imitates actual life more closely than his two great
rivals. Nothing is gained, however, by ignoring the
comic element. The altercation between Apollo and
Thanatos contains much that surprises us—the wit<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and
the eager, wrangling, bargaining tone of the dispute.
Again the quarrel between Pheres and his son, admirable
in its skilful revelation of character, jars terribly when
enacted over the body of Alcestis. Heracles’ half-tipsy
lecture to the slave shocks us in a demigod about to
wrestle with Death himself. But the whole situation as
between Alcestis and Admetus, Admetus and Heracles,
is handled with dignity and extraordinary pathos. The
death scene, especially Admetus’ despairing address to
his wife; the even finer passage when the king returns
but shrinks from the cold aspect of his widowed house;
the magnificent and lovely odes, above all the song
which describes the wild beasts of Othrys’ side sporting
to the music of Apollo—these are thoroughly suited to
tragedy.</p>

<p>The plot is apparently<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> quite simple, but one fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
should be mentioned. The rescue of Alcestis is due
directly to the drunkenness of Heracles. He is prevented
from learning the facts in an ordinary way by
Admetus; had he behaved normally, he would have
left Pheræ still unenlightened, since Admetus has forbidden<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
his slave to speak. It is his intoxication alone
which goads the butler to explain.</p>

<p>The character-drawing is skilful, often subtle. Heracles,
good-hearted but somewhat dense, sensual and
coarse-fibred, is half-way between the demigod of the
<i>Heracles Furens</i> and the boisterous glutton of comedy.
Capable of splendid impulses, he is yet a masterpiece
of breezy tactlessness, as when with hideous slyness he
suggests to Admetus (in the presence of the restored
wife) that the king may console himself by a new marriage.
Pheres and Admetus are an admirable pair.
Both are selfish, Admetus with pathetic unconsciousness,
his father with cynical candour. Pheres is quite willing
to give elaborate honour to the dead woman so long as
it costs little; Admetus—is it true of him that he is
ready to utter splendid heroic speeches so long as the
sacrifice is made to save him? Not so; he feels terribly.
But the comparison between father and son reminds
us how easily sentiment can become aged into etiquette.
At present, however, he is a man of generous instincts—“spoiled”.
He needs a salutary upheaval of his home:
from afar he prophesies of Thorvald Helmer in <i>A Doll’s
House</i>. Alcestis herself is a curious study. Innumerable
readers have extolled her as one of the noblest figures
in Euripides’ great gallery of heroines; this in spite of
the fact that she is frigid and unimaginative, ungenerous
and basely narrow, in her spiritual and social outlook.
One great and noble deed stands to her credit—she is
voluntarily dying to preserve Admetus’ life. Our profound
respect Alcestis can certainly claim, but the love
and pity of which so much is said are scarcely due to
her. They are extorted, if at all, by the elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
exertions of the other characters, who vie with one
another in painting a picture of the tenderness which has
illumined the Pheræan palace like quiet sunshine. But
a dramatist cannot build up a great character by a series
of testimonies from friends. He has undoubtedly portrayed
an interesting personality, as he always does, but
to put her beside creations like Medea and Phædra is
merely absurd. From the beginning of her first intolerable
speech<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> we know her for that frightful figure, the
thoroughly good woman with no imagination, no humour,
no insight. One hears much of the failures of Euripides;
this is perhaps a real failure. For we are not to suppose
that the rigidity and coldness of Alcestis are a
dexterous stroke of art; it is not his intention to give a
novel, true, and unflattering portrait of a traditional stage
favourite, as he so often delighted to do. Everything
indicates that he wished to make Alcestis sublime and
lovable. But there is a fatal difference between her
and the later women. Euripides has realized her from
the outside. He has given us in the mouths of the other
characters warm descriptions of her charm, but he has
not succeeded in drawing a charming woman. She has
not “come alive” in his hands.</p>

<p>The plot of the <i>Alcestis</i> has been studied by the
late Dr. Verrall in an essay<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> of extraordinary skill
and interest. He lays special emphasis on certain
peculiar features in the treatment. First, Heracles
is represented as in no way the sublime demigod who
ought to have been depicted, in view of the amazing
exploit which awaits him; the only heroic language
put into his mouth is uttered when he is intoxicated,
and the account—if it can be called such—which he
gives later of Alcestis’ deliverance shows a studied
lack of impressiveness. Second, Alcestis is interred
with unheard-of speed; Admetus, seeing her expire,
instantly makes ready to convey her body to the tomb.
From these facts in chief and from many details Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Verrall deduces his theory that Alcestis never dies
at all. Her expectation of death (founded on the story
about Apollo’s bargain) and the atmosphere of mourning
which hangs over Admetus’ house and capital on the
fatal day, have so wrought upon the queen that she
finally swoons. Later Heracles visits the tomb, finds
Alcestis recovering, and restores her to the king. His
annoyance with Admetus, which leads him to allow
his host to “think what he pleases,” coupled with his
own rodomontade at the palace gate, gave rise to
the legend that Heracles fought with Death for a
woman who had actually quitted life. Finally, the
quasi-theological prologue, in which Apollo and Thanatos
appear and give warrant to the orthodox rendering
of the story, is a mere figment, revealed as such to
the discreet by its utterly ungodlike tone, and only
tacked on to a quite human drama in order to save
the poet from legal indictment as an enemy of current
theology.</p>

<p>This superb essay has met with wide-spread admiration,
some adhesion, much opposition, but no
refutation. If we are to judge of the existing plays as
one mass, the examination of outstanding specimens
of rationalism such as the <i>Ion</i> will convince us that
the <i>Alcestis</i> is what Dr. Verrall thought it. But this
play does stand apart from the rest, as do the <i>Rhesus</i>
and the <i>Cyclops</i>. However close it may lie to the
<i>Medea</i> in date, it is very early in manner; a capital instance
of this, the character of Alcestis, has already been
mentioned. The best view is, perhaps, that curious
features which in other works might appear so bad
as to be evidently intended for some other than the
ostensible purpose, are in this case due to inexpertness.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
For example, the extraordinary fact that Alcestis’ rescue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
is due to nothing but the drunkenness of Heracles, is
perhaps a mere oversight on the poet’s part. Similarly
the poorness of the last scene may be no cunning
device, but comparative poverty of inspiration. It is
a tenable view that Euripides intended to write a
quite orthodox treatment of the story, but has only
partially succeeded in reaching the sureness and brilliance
of his later compositions.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Medea</span> (Μήδεια) was produced in 431 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
as the first play of a tetralogy containing also <i>Philoctetes</i>,
<i>Dictys</i>, and the satyric play <i>The Harvesters</i> (Θερισταί).
Euripides obtained only the third prize, and even Sophocles
was second to Euphorion, son of Æschylus.
The scene represents the house of Medea at Corinth.
She has come there with her two young sons, and her
husband Jason, whom she helped to gain the Golden
Fleece in Colchis. Jason has become estranged from
Medea, owing to his projected marriage with Glauce,
the daughter of King Creon. At this point the play
opens. The aged nurse of Medea comes forth and,
in one of the most celebrated speeches in Euripides,
laments her mistress’ flight from Colchis and her subsequent
troubles; she fears that Medea will seek
revenge. The two boys return from play, attended
by their old “pædagogus,” who informs his fellow-servant
that King Creon intends to banish Medea and
her children. The nurse sends them within. The
chorus of Corinthian women enter and inquire after
Medea, who comes from the house in the deepest
distress. She speaks with deep feeling about the
sorrows and restraints which society puts upon women,<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
and after a pathetic description of her own forlorn
state, begs her visitors to aid by silence if she finds
any means of revenge. They have just consented,
when Creon appears and orders her to leave the land
on the instant, with her children. When she expostulates,
he explains that he fears her: she is well
known as a magician; moreover, she has uttered
threats against himself, his daughter, and Jason. Medea
in vain seeks to escape her reputation for “wisdom”;
in spite of her offer to live quietly in Corinth, Creon
repeats his behest. By urgent pleading, she obtains
from him one day’s grace. When the king has departed,
Medea addresses the chorus with fierce triumph:
she now has opportunity for revenge. After considering
possible methods, she decides on poison. But first,
what refuge is she to find when her plot has succeeded?
she will wait a little, and if no chance of safe retirement
shows itself, she will attack her foes sword in hand.
The chorus, impressed by her spirit, declare that after
all the centuries during which poets have covered
women with infamy, now at last honour is coming to
their sex. They lament the decay of truth and honour,
as shown in Jason’s desertion. Jason enters, reproaching
Medea for her folly in alienating the king,
but offering help to lighten her banishment. Medea
falls upon him in a terrible speech, relating all the
benefits she has conferred and the crime she has committed
in his cause. Jason replies that it was the
Love-God which constrained her to help him, nor is
he ungrateful. But she has her reward—a reputation
among the Greeks for wisdom. He is contracting
this new marriage to provide for his children; Medea’s
complaints are due to short-sighted jealousy. After
a bitter debate, in which Medea scornfully refuses his
aid, he retires. The chorus sing the dread power
of Love, and lament the wreck which it has made
of Medea’s life. A stranger enters—Ægeus, King
of Athens, who has been to Delphi for an oracle
which shall remove his childlessness. Medea begs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
him to give her shelter in Athens whenever she comes
thither from Corinth; in return for this, she will by
her art remove his childlessness. He consents, and
withdraws. Sure of her future, Medea now triumphantly
expounds her plan. She will make a pretended reconciliation
with Jason and beg that her children be
allowed to remain. They are to seek Jason’s bride,
bearing presents in order to win this favour. These
gifts will be poisoned; the princess and all who touch
her will perish. Then she will slay her children to
complete the misery of Jason. The chorus in vain
protest; she turns from them and despatches a slave
to summon Jason. The choric ode which follows extols,
in lines of amazing loveliness, the glory of Attica—its
atmosphere of wisdom, poetry, and love. But
how shall such a land harbour a murderess? Jason
returns, and is greeted by Medea with a speech of
contrition by which he is entirely deceived. She calls
her children forth, and there is a pathetic scene which
affects her, for all her guilty purpose, with genuine
emotion. She puts her pretended plan before Jason,
and watches the father depart with the two boys and
their pædagogus carrying the presents. The ode
which follows laments the fatal step that has now
been taken. The pædagogus brings the boys back with
news that their sentence of exile has been remitted,
and that the princess has accepted the gifts. Medea
addresses herself to the next task. Now that her plot
against Glauce is in train, the children must die. The
famous soliloquy which follows exhibits the sway alternately
exerted over her by maternal love and the
thirst for revenge; after a dreadful struggle she determines
to obey her “passion” and embrace vengeance.
The children are sent within. The next ode is a
most painfully real and intimate revelation of a parent’s
anxiety and sorrows. A messenger hurries up, crying
to Medea that she must flee; Creon and his daughter
are both dead. Medea greets his news with cool
delight, braces herself for her last deed, and enters the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
house. The chorus utter a desperate prayer to the
Sun-god to save his descendants; but at once the
children’s cries are heard. Scarcely have they died
away when Jason furiously enters, followed by henchmen.
His chief thought is to save his children from
the vengeance of Creon’s kinsmen. The chorus at
once tell him they are dead, and how. In frenzy he
flings himself upon the door. But he suddenly recoils
as the voice of Medea, clear and contemptuous, descends
from the air. She is seen on high, driving a magic
chariot given to her by the Sun-god. There breaks
out a frightful wounding altercation, Jason begging
wildly to be allowed to see and to bury his children’s
bodies, Medea sternly refusing; she will herself bury
them beyond the borders of Corinth. She departs
through the air, leaving Jason utterly broken.</p>

<p>The literary history of this play is extremely interesting,
though obscure. First, is it later, or earlier, than
the <i>Trachiniæ</i>? One general idea is common to the two
tragedies; but the treatment is utterly dissimilar, and one
may not unreasonably believe that Sophocles has sought
to reprove Euripides, to paint his own conception of a
noble wronged wife, and to show how a woman so placed
should demean herself. Secondly, there is some reason<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
to believe that two editions of the <i>Medea</i> where for a time
in existence. Euripides almost certainly himself remodelled
the work, presumably for a second “production,”
but to what extent it is hard to say. Thirdly, and
above all, there is the question of his originality. The
longer Greek “argument” asserts that he appears to
have borrowed the drama from Neophron and to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
introduced alterations. This interesting problem has
been discussed elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Neophron’s play, if one is to
judge by the style and versification of his brief fragments,
should be regarded as written early in the second half
of the fifth century.</p>

<p>The dramatic structure of the <i>Medea</i> calls for the
closest attention. In Sophocles we have observed how
that collision of wills and emotions, which is always the
soul of drama, arises from the confrontation of two
persons. In the present drama that collision takes place
in the bosom of a single person. Sophocles would
probably have given us a Jason whose claim upon our
sympathy was hardly less than that of Medea. Complication,
with him, is to be found in his plots, not in his
characters. But here we have a subject which has since
proved so rich a mine of tragic and romantic interest—the
study of a soul divided against itself. Medea’s
wrongs, her passionate resentment, and her plans of revenge
do not merely dominate the play, they <i>are</i> the
play from the first line to the close. Certain real or
alleged structural defects should be noted. First, we observe
the incredible part taken by the chorus; they raise
not a finger to stay the designs of Medea upon the king
and his daughter; and we are given no reason to suppose
that they are unfriendly to the royal house. The episode
of Ægeus, moreover, is puzzling. Though quite necessary
in view of Medea’s helpless condition and prepared for
by her remarks as to a “tower of refuge,”<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> it is quite
unneeded by one who can command a magic flying
chariot. Moreover, this chariot itself has been often
censured, notably by Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> who regards it as to
all intents and purposes a <i>deus ex machina</i>, and on this
ground very properly objects to it.</p>

<p>Dr. Verrall’s<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> theory meets all these difficulties.
He supposes that several of Euripides’ plays were
originally written for private performance. The <i>Medea</i>,
so acted, had no obtrusive chorus, and no miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
escape of the murderess. To the episode of Ægeus
corresponded a <i>finale</i> in which Medea, by allowing her
husband to bury the bodies of his children, and by
instituting the religious rites referred to in our present
text,<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> induced both Jason and the Corinthians to allow
her safe passage to Athens. This view, or a view
essentially resembling it, must be accepted, not so much
because of the absurdity involved (as it appears to us)
by the presence of the chorus, as the utter futility of
the Ægeus-scene in the present state of the text.</p>

<p>The characterization shows Euripides at his best.
In the heroine he gives us the first and possibly the
finest of his marvellous studies in feminine human
nature. Alcestis he viewed and described from without;
Medea he has imagined from within. Her passionate
love, which is so easily perverted by brutality into
murderous hate, her pride, will-power, ferocity, and
dæmonic energy, are all depicted with flawless mastery
and sympathy. Desperate and cruel as this woman
shows herself, she is no cold-blooded plotter. Creon
has heard of her unguarded threats, and his knowledge
wellnigh ruins her project. Her first words to Jason,
“thou utter villain,” followed by a complete and appalling
indictment of his cynicism<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and ingratitude,
are not calculated to lull suspicion. But however passionate,
she owns a splendid intellect. She faces facts<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
and understands her weaknesses. When seeking an
advantage, she can hold herself magnificently in hand.
The pretended reconciliation with Jason is a scene of
weird thrill for the spectators. Her archness in discussing
his influence over the young princess is almost
hideous; and while she weeps in his arms we remember
with sick horror her scornful words after practising
successfully the same arts on the king. Above all, there
is here no petulant railing at “unjust gods,” or “blind
fate”. Her undoing in the past has come from “trust
in the words of a man that is a Greek”;<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> her present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
murderous rage springs from no <i>Até</i> but from her own
passion (θυμός). The dramatist has set himself to
express human life in terms of humanity.</p>

<p>Jason is a superb study—a compound of brilliant
manner, stupidity, and cynicism. If only his own
desires, interests, and comforts are safe, he is prepared
to confer all kinds of benefits. The kindly, breezy
words which he addresses to his little sons must have
made hundreds of excellent fathers in the audience feel
for a moment a touch of personal baseness—“am I not
something like this?” That is the moral of Jason and
countless personages of Euripides: they are so detestable
and yet so like ourselves. Jason indeed dupes
himself as well as others. He really thinks he is kind
and gentle, when he is only surrendering to an emotional
atmosphere. His great weakness is the mere perfection
of his own egotism; he has no power at all to realize
another’s point of view. Throughout the play he simply
refuses to believe that Medea feels his desertion as she
asserts. For him her complaints are “empty words”.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
To the very end his self-centred stupidity is almost
pathetic: “didst thou <i>in truth</i> determine on their death
for the sake of wifely honour?”<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> One of the most deadly
things in the play hangs on this blindness. Medea has
just asked him, with whatever smile she can summon
up, to induce “your wife” to procure pardon for the
children. Jason, instead of destroying himself on the
spot in self-contempt, replies courteously: “By all
means; and I imagine that I shall persuade her, <i>if she
is like the rest of women</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Considering all the circumstances,
this is perhaps unsurpassed for shameless
brutality. Medea, however, with a gleam in her eye
which one may imagine, answers with equal urbanity,
even with quiet raillery. She has perhaps no reason
to complain; it is precisely this portentous insensibility
which will secure her success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>The minor characters are, in their degree, excellently
drawn—Creon above all. His short scene is unforgettable;
it is that familiar sight—a weak man encouraging
himself to firmness by exaggerating his own severity.
His delicious little grumble, “my chivalrous instincts
have got me into trouble more often than I like to think
of,”<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> stamps him as the peer of Dogberry and Justice
Shallow.</p>

<p>As a piece of Greek, the <i>Medea</i> is perhaps the finest
work of Euripides. The iambics have a simple
brilliance and flexible ease which had been unknown
hitherto, and which indeed were never rivalled afterwards.

Heracles</i>, is a short<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> play of uncertain date, usually referred
to the early years of the Peloponnesian War (431-404)
and by some to the date 422 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Nothing is
known as to the companion plays, or the success obtained
by the tetralogy.</p>

<p>The scene is laid before the temple of Zeus at Marathon
in Attica. The young sons of Heracles are discovered
with the aged Iolaus, their father’s comrade,
who explains how, after Heracles departed to Heaven,
Eurystheus of Argos has hunted the hero’s family through
Greece. They have taken refuge in Attica; Alcmena,
mother of Heracles, and the daughters are now within
the temple; Hyllus, the eldest son, has gone to seek
another refuge in case Athens fails them. Copreus,<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> a
herald from Argos, enters and is dragging the suppliants
away when the chorus of aged Athenians enter.
Copreus disregards their remonstrances, but is confronted
by the king, Demophon, and his brother Acamas. He
insists that the Heracleidæ are Argive subjects: let not
Demophon risk war with Argos. Iolaus appeals for
protection, and is granted it; Copreus retires with threats
of instant war. After an ode of defiance by the chorus,
Demophon returns with news that a noble virgin must
be sacrificed to Persephone, and he will not slay an
Athenian girl. Iolaus is in despair, when Macaria, one
of Heracles’ daughters, comes forth and offers herself.
After a proud but melancholy farewell she goes. A serf
of Hyllus arrives, bringing, he says, good news. At this
Iolaus joyfully summons Alcmena, who imagines that
another herald is assaulting him; but he announces that
Hyllus has returned with a large host of allies. Iolaus,
despite the serf’s rueful gibes, insists on going to the fray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
and, dressed in ancient arms from the temple, totters off.
The chorus proclaim the justice of their cause, invoking
Zeus and Athena. The attendant returns with news of
complete victory. Iolaus was taken into Hyllus’ chariot
and being (by favour of Heracles and Hebe) miraculously
restored for a while to his youthful vigour, captured
Eurystheus. The chorus celebrate the glory of Athens and
acclaim Heracles, who is now proved (despite report) to be
dwelling in Heaven. Eurystheus is led in and Alcmena
gloats over him, promising him death. The messenger
intervenes: Athenians do not kill prisoners. She insists.
Then Eurystheus breaks silence: it was Hera
who forced him to these persecutions, and if he is now
slain in cold blood, a curse will fall on the slayer. The
chorus at length accept Alcmena’s evasion that he
be killed and his corpse be given to his friends. Eurystheus
presents Athens with an oracle which declares that
his spirit shall be hostile to the Heracleidæ, when, forgetting
this kindness, they invade Attica.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Alcmena bids
her attendants convey Eurystheus within and destroy
him. The chorus<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> briefly express satisfaction at being
free from this guilt, and the play ends.</p>

<p>The <i>Heracleidæ</i> is one of the least popular<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> among
Euripides’ works. It has indeed unmistakable beauties.
The heroic daughter of Heracles and her proud insistence
on no rivalry in her sacrifice have always moved
admiration. The Greek style, moreover, though not
equal to that of the <i>Medea</i>, has all the Euripidean limpidity
and ease. Such lines as</p>

<p class="noindent">haunt the ear. Moreover, the chivalry with which
Demophon and his citizens champion the helpless must
have stirred Athenian hearts. But our pleasure is
repeatedly checked by incidents grotesque, horrible, or
inexplicable. To the first category belongs the absurd
scene in which Iolaus totters away amid badinage to do
battle with Argos. There is a comic note, again, in the
scene where Alcmena for the first time appears and supposes
that Hyllus’ messenger is another hostile herald
from Argos. As we know who he is, her attack on
him shows that painful mixture of the pathetic and
the ludicrous which so often marks Euripides’ work;
here the comic prevails over the touching. Secondly,
the interview in which Eurystheus is presented to
Alcmena, who gloats at her ease over him, is horrible,
however natural. And finally the inexplicable or at
least puzzling features are perhaps the most striking
of all.</p>

<p>The first difficulty concerns the personality which
forms the background of the whole; the apotheosis
of Heracles is treated in equivocal fashion throughout.
Iolaus<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> alone seems entirely convinced. Alcmena,
after news of the victory to which her son has given
miraculous aid, utters the candid words:—<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">After long years, O Zeus, my woes have touched thee,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I know in truth doth dwell amid the gods.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And her faith is echoed in less prosaic language<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> by the
chorus, who proclaim the falsehood of the story that
Heracles after his passing by fire went down to the
abode of Hades; in truth he dwells in Heaven and in the
golden court lives as the spouse of Hebe. But these
confessions are due to the marvels on the battle-field,
marvels upon which the narrator himself takes pains to
throw grave doubt.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Macaria, though she has every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
reason<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> to dilate on the glories of her father, speaks
of him but briefly and with only the normal filial respect.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
Of the others, Copreus ignores him; from the
man’s character we expect sneers and refutations of the
miraculous stories such as are put by our poet in the
mouth of Lycus.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Eurystheus speaks of him generously,
but in terms which imply that he has never heard, much
less accepted, the marvellous accounts of his enemy: “I
knew thy son was no mere cypher, but in good sooth
a man; for even though he was mine enemy, yet will
I speak well of him, that man of worth”.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Demophon
himself, the champion of Heracles’ children, even when
he has been reminded (by Iolaus) how the hero rescued
Theseus, father of Demophon, from Hades itself, in his
reply treats this overwhelming claim ambiguously and
with nothing more than politeness.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> All this seems to
show the dramatist’s belief that Heracles was simply a
“noble man”—an ἐσθλὸς ἀνήρ—whose divine traits are
the offspring of minds like those of Iolaus and Alcmena,
whose sagacity throughout the drama is painfully low.</p>

<p>Macaria’s fate, also, at first sight causes perplexity.
After she leaves the scene, nothing<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> more is heard of
her. When and where she dies we are not told; the
promise<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> of Iolaus that she shall be honoured by him
in death, as in life, above all women, produces no effect—for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
we are told nothing about her burial; whether
the advent of Hyllus’ reinforcements should or does
make any difference to the necessity for the sacrifice is
not discussed. But there is good reason to suppose
that a whole episode, on Macaria’s death, has been lost.</p>

<p>The army of Hyllus is the most astonishing feature
in the play. All the action and all the pathos depend
upon the helplessness which involves the Heracleidæ.
Every other city has rejected them; if Athens fails all
is lost—so we are told repeatedly.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Yet at the last
moment Hyllus returns with a positive army. Whence
has it come? How can Iolaus have been ignorant that
such aid was possible? We are told nothing. The
Athenian leaders apparently, Iolaus and Alcmena<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
certainly, receive these incredible tidings with no
feeling save placid satisfaction.</p>

<p>Finally, if this drama is composed in order to extol
the nobility of Athens in espousing the cause of the
weak, it is extraordinary that so dubious an example
should be selected. The suppliants are ancestors of
those very Spartans who, when the drama was produced,
were the bitter and dangerous enemies of Athens. Was
not her ancient kindness in saving the first generation of
these foes a piece of folly? Eurystheus points this moral
at the close.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Alcmena herself, in her cold ferocity<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
and her quibbling<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> over the dues of piety, is a clear
prophecy of what fifth-century Athenians most detested
in the Spartan character. Moreover, the plea of Copreus
is perfectly just: Argos has a right to punish her own
people if condemned; whether they were wrongly so
condemned is no concern of Athens.</p>

<p>The upshot seems to be that Eurystheus has a bitter
quarrel with a powerful noble, so bitter that when his
enemy dies the king dares not leave his children at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
large. Through the sentimental weakness of her ruler
Athens is drawn into the dispute, and history shows that
she made a frightful mistake.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hippolytus</span><a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> (Ἱππόλυτος Στεφανίας<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
    or Στεφανηφόρος)
was produced in 428 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and obtained the first
prize. The scene is laid in Trœzen before a house
belonging to Theseus, King of Athens. Aphrodite, the
goddess of love, speaks the prologue, explaining how
Hippolytus, son of Theseus, scorns her and consorts
always with Artemis, the virgin huntress-deity. Aphrodite
therefore has caused Phædra, the wife of Theseus,
to fall in love with her stepson. The king in his wrath
shall bring about the death of his son. The prince
enters followed by his huntsmen, and turning to the
statue of Artemis with a beautiful prayer places garlands
upon it, but disregards the image of Aphrodite. After
the hunters have entered the palace, the chorus of
Trœzenian women come to inquire after the ailing
Phædra. She is borne forth, attended by her nurse, who
seeks to calm the feverishness of her mistress and her
passionate longing for the wild regions of the chase.
She gradually learns that the queen is consumed by
passion for Hippolytus. Phædra, now quite calm,
describes her fight with temptation; when she saw that
victory was impossible she chose death, and for this
reason has refused food. The nurse offers very different
counsel. Why should Phædra strive against her instincts?
Even the gods have erred through love; she
will cure her mistress. The remedy, she soon hints, is
nothing but surrender. At this Phædra is so indignant
that the other again takes refuge in ambiguity; she
retires to fetch certain charms. The ode which follows
proclaims the irresistible sway of love. The queen, in
the meantime, has been standing near the palace-door<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
and now recoils in horror—she has heard Hippolytus
reviling the nurse; nothing, she cries, is now left to her
but speedy death. Hippolytus enters in fury, followed
by the nurse. After an altercation in which he threatens
to break his oath of secrecy, he breaks forth into a
lengthy and bitter tirade against women, but finally
promises to keep his oath. When the prince has retired
Phædra proclaims her resolve to avoid shame for her
family and herself by death, obtaining from the chorus
a promise not to divulge what has occurred; at the
same time she obscurely threatens Hippolytus. After
she has gone, the chorus voice their yearning to be free
from this world of sin and woe; surely this trouble is
a curse brought by Phædra from her house in Crete, a
curse which is even now forcing her neck into the noose.
A messenger rushes forth crying out that the queen has
hanged herself. Theseus returns home and is speedily
apprised of his loss. Suddenly he sees a letter clutched
in his dead wife’s hand; on reading it he announces
in fury that Hippolytus has violated his connubial
rights. He appeals to his father Poseidon, god of the
sea, who has promised to grant him any three prayers,
to destroy Hippolytus. The prince returns, and Theseus,
after a stinging attack on his son’s pretensions, banishes
him. Hippolytus is prevented by his oath from defending
himself effectually, and sorrowfully turns away.
The chorus ponder upon the mysterious ways of Heaven
and lament the downfall of the brilliant prince. One of
Hippolytus’ attendants returns and informs Theseus
that his son is on the point of death. A gigantic bull,
sent by Poseidon out of the sea, terrified Hippolytus’
horses, which bolted and mangled their master. Theseus
receives these tidings with grim satisfaction, but the
goddess Artemis appears and reveals all the facts.
Theseus is utterly prostrated. Hippolytus is carried
in, lamenting his agony and unmerited fate. Artemis
converses with him affectionately and there follows
between the two men a few words lamenting the curse
fulfilled by Poseidon. Artemis consoles her favourite and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
disappears. Hippolytus gives his father full forgiveness,
and dies in his embrace.</p>

<p>The main impression left by a repeated study of this
magnificent drama is a sense of the loveliness and delight
which the transfusing genius of a poet can throw
around the ruin worked by blind instinct and hate, even
around a whole world tortured by belief in gods whose
supreme intelligence, will, and power, are quick to
punish, but never pardon. No poem in the world conveys
more pungently the aroma of life’s inextinguishable
beauty and preciousness. Life does not become ugly
because full of sin or pain. It can only become ugly by
growing unintelligible. So long as it can be understood,
it remains to man, whose joys are all founded upon perception,
a thing that can be loved; this is the one and
sufficient reason why tragic drama is beautiful.</p>

<p>For the writer of the <i>Hippolytus</i>, then, life is something
profoundly sorrowful yet profoundly dear. Hippolytus’
address to Artemis on his return from the chase
is compact of that mystic loveliness which fills remote
glades with a visible presentment of the beauty of holiness:—</p>

<p class="noindent">Theseus himself expresses this sense of the fragile
beauty of life in lines<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> which recall the unearthly charm
of Sophocles:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">ὄρνις γὰρ ὥς τις ἐκ χερῶν ἄφαντος εἶ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">πήδημ’ ἐς Αἵδου κραιπνὸν ὁρμήσασά μοι.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Even Artemis the unloving can tell of life’s charm surviving
death itself in some wise, an immortality of
beautiful remembrance.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Throughout, the poet has
used all his power to invest the theme with loveliness of
phrasing. Elsewhere, skilful as his writing is, he often
gives us what is practically prose; the <i>Hippolytus</i> is his
nearest approach to the manner of Sophocles.</p>

<p>Nor is the likeness confined to verbal expression.
The theology is, or claims to be, the theology of
Sophocles. The traditional Olympians are accepted as
persons, with the powers and purposes which current
belief attributed to them. This is the view which
Sophocles accepts and expounds. Euripides who certainly
did not accept it, here expounds it—in his own
way and with deadly results. Many times Euripides
questions the very existence of these deities, but now he
sees fit to accept them for a moment, and depicts life as
lived under such rulers. Men and women can feel and
recreate the beauty of this world, but these gods time and
again dash all into pitiful fragments. “The world is ruled
by stupid fiends, who spend eternity thwarting one another.
Do we dwell in a universe or a grinning chaos?”</p>

<p>Is this all? Very far from it. Almost all the
action of the tragedy could be accounted for—had we
not this disconcerting divine explanation—on purely
“human” lines, though what “human” means is, as
the poet plainly perceives, no less difficult a question
than that of theology. But at least the sorrows of
Trœzen scarcely need the baneful <i>persons</i> of Olympus.
For the three sufferers are, after all, not blameless.
They share that casual sinfulness—for we cannot avoid
the use of question-begging words—which is the lot
of man. Hippolytus errs (in Greek eyes) by his complete
aversion from sexual passion; he errs in all eyes
by the arrogance with which he proclaims it. His
famous speech<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> is too long for a spontaneous burst of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
resentment; it becomes a frigid piece of self-glorification.
It is precisely this arrogance which stings Phædra
to the thought of revenge.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Theseus, in spite of the
pathetic blindness with which he imputes<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> his misery to
some ancestor’s sin, is the original cause of it. Hippolytus
is the offspring of his youthful incontinence.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
Then, when he has “settled down,” it is precisely his
respectable marriage which brings the consequence of
his early amour to fruition; his son and his young wife
are of nearly the same age. As for Phædra herself, the
passion which she feels need not be attributed to a personal
goddess. Lawlessness is in her veins; her mother
and sister have both sinned:<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Crete, “the Isle of Awful
Love,”<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> brands its name upon line after line of the play.
For this predisposition to unchastity many of Euripides’
contemporaries, as of our own, would have blamed her
heartily. The poet himself does not, as his splendidly
sympathetic treatment of her shows; but neither does
he feel any need to lay the blame upon Aphrodite.
Phædra’s offence, her contribution to disaster, lies in
her early toying with her passion, when she founded
a shrine of the love-goddess in Hippolytus’ name;<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
in her accompanying Theseus (apparently without a
struggle) to Trœzen and the society of the prince; in
her determination to punish Hippolytus for his bitter
pride.</p>

<p>To banish “the gods” and attribute sin to “heredity,”
is that not merely to substitute one word for
another? Yes, but the poet herein has his eye fixed on
formal theology. Well aware that the glib invocation
of “heredity” or “environment” is no more conclusive
than “the will of the gods,” he yet insists that sin is a
matter of psychology. We must study human nature if
we mean to understand and conquer sin. If we regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
Aphrodite or Artemis as <i>persons</i> external to ourselves
and of superhuman power we lose all hope of moral improvement
in our own hearts. But if we accept these
devastating powers as forces in human nature, we may
hope by study and self-discipline in some degree to
control them.</p>

<p>Thus the drama is full of subtly wise psychology:
it is an interesting comment on much that has been
written about “realist” play-writing that the <i>Hippolytus</i>,
which contains some of the most romantic poetry in
Greek literature, is also as sincere and profound in
characterization as the work of Ibsen himself. Theseus
and his son we have already considered; Phædra and
her nurse require deeper study. The latter is a masterpiece
among the “minor” characters of Euripides.
Her tenderness for the young queen and passionate
desire at all costs to win her peace; the dignity which
life and its contemplation can give even to coarse-fibred<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
natures; her feeling for the deepest pathos of life—these
things constitute a great dramatic figure. It is to
her that the poet gives his most poignant expression of
that mingled pain and beauty which we discussed a
moment ago:—</p>

<p class="noindent">She, too, it is who in words<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> of almost equal beauty

<p class="noindent">The nurse makes moral weakness into a very religion,<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
and Phædra’s heart, one would suppose, is finally broken
when, to this appeal that the gods themselves are
against her, is added proof that man is utterly unable to
understand. “If thy life had not been in such danger,”
says the nurse, “and thou hadst <i>happened to be a chaste
woman</i>, I should not thus lead thee on,”<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> and again:
“<i>Thy duty, to be sure, forbids sin; but, as things are</i>,
be advised by me”.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> This hideous purring is perhaps
Phædra’s bitterest shame. No one can understand,
except the prince who seems so utterly remote.
Hippolytus, after her death, can say<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Unchaste in passion, chaste in soul was she;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Me hath my passionless purity dishonoured.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What does Phædra herself say? Is there any reply to
the dreadful eloquence of her old attendant? There is
only one reply conceivable, and she offers it: “Whatever
gods may do, or men think, I must so act as to be able
to respect myself”.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Euripides insists that the centre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
of ethics lies in man himself. For Phædra there is no
soul on which she can rely but her own; the conflict
must be fought out within herself. The great speech<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
in which she tells her spiritual history to the chorus
without any reserve or faltering, is the kernel of the
tragedy. We realize how empty of all comfort life can
be for those who resolutely reject outworn creeds and
turn to seek for a better. Here is no thought, no hint,
of a saviour; the puny soul must struggle alone with an
uncomprehended universe. Æschylus had found a
saviour in Zeus;<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Euripides can see no comfort in gods
who are less virtuous than men. In this speech, too,
we note for the first time a portrayal of moral temptation
and a clear conception of conscience. Sophocles understands
well how duty can brace the soul to heroic life
or death, but for him the sanction of duty lies in the
will of external deities. For Euripides conscience is
sufficient as a rule of conduct.</p>

<p>Phædra is a masterpiece of characterization. Whatever
we are to guess of the earlier<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> picture, she is here
a noble and spirited woman, who cannot help her instincts
but who can and will dispute their power over
her life. She is, of course, not perfect—if she were she
would be no fit subject for drama—and the manner in
which Euripides has caused the action to hinge precisely
upon her weaknesses, without lessening our respect and
affection, is one of the most improving studies provided
by dramatic art. The little crevices of circumstance
by which wrong-doing—the destruction of Hippolytus—creeps
into her soul are beautifully indicated. She is
wasted by fasting,<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> a state conducive to keener perception
and weaker will. She has been brought—without
any attempt on her part, so surely she may indulge in the
disastrous joy<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>—from Athens to the little town where
the prince lives. Her husband, as it chances,<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> is from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
home and her life is left empty for “long, long
thoughts”.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> When she dwells upon her passion the
recollection of her mother’s and her sister’s fate half
attracts while it half repels.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Her passionate nature
insists on revealing some part of her distress to the keen
eyes of the nurse, who forthwith joins the claims of old
affection<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> to this new secret pain. So it is that she is
half-conquered by what she will not do:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, in God’s name, forbear! Thy words are vile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But wise withal. Love in my soul too well</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And passion sweeps my fears into the gulf.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the nurse will not forbear, and the comforting
promise of a charm which shall “still this disease,”<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> as
Phædra perhaps half-suspects,<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> is an undertaking to win
Hippolytus. The dread strain of illness, passion, and
shame have turned the woman for a moment into a
nervous child.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Thus it comes about that without disgrace,
without forfeiture of her conscience, Phædra
moves towards the dread moment<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> at which she hears
the outcry of Hippolytus. Then after all the anguish,
she listens to his intolerable endless speech! Such is
the situation in which murder is conceived. In this way
Hippolytus’ σωφροσύνη has certainly been his undoing.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>We are told<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> that this play is a second version of
the theme, and that it was called <i>The Crowned Hippolytus</i>
(from the lovely address to Artemis) to distinguish
it from the first, called <i>The Veiled Hippolytus</i>.
This version (now lost) is said to have contained “improprieties”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
which the poet afterwards removed. This
refers to the attitude of Phædra, who showed less reserve
in her passion than in the later play. She invoked
the moon-goddess, perhaps to aid her in winning Hippolytus,
and boldly pointed to the infidelities of Theseus
as an excuse for her own passion.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> The reproaches<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
which Aristophanes lays upon Phædra refer perhaps only
to this earlier version, but his most famous gibe<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> is upon
a line<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> of our text,</p>

<p class="noindent">“My tongue hath sworn; my soul abides unsworn.”
This seems to give us the measure of the comic poet’s
criticism; he blames Euripides for this sentiment, and
yet Hippolytus even in his most desperate trouble will
not clear himself by breaking his oath. One cannot, however,
refrain from pointing out that even if he had broken
it, Theseus would not have believed him,<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and that Hippolytus
realizes this.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hecuba</span> (Ἑκάβη) is the next play in order of
date; it was performed about 425 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> This tragedy
was enormously popular throughout antiquity, as the
great volume of the scholia proves. It was one of the
three plays—the others were <i>Phœnissæ</i> and <i>Orestes</i>—used
as an Euripidean reading-book in the Byzantine
schools.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in Thrace, where the Greeks are
encamped after the fall of Troy; the background is a
tent wherein captive Trojan women are quartered. The
ghost of Polydorus, Priam’s youngest son, tells how he
has been murdered by the Thracian king, Polymestor;
he has appeared in a dream to his mother Hecuba. On
his departure, Hecuba enters, and soon learns that her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
daughter Polyxena is to be sacrificed at the tomb of
Achilles. Odysseus comes to fetch the maiden, who
welcomes death as a relief from slavery. Soon Talthybius
enters, summoning Hecuba to bury Polyxena, whose
noble death has filled the Greeks with admiration.
Hecuba sends a woman to fetch sea-water for the
obsequies, and this messenger returns with the body
of Polydorus. Hecuba exclaims that the murderer is
Polymestor: her dream has told her. Agamemnon
enters, and she induces him to connive at her taking
vengeance upon the Thracian, his ally. Next she sends
for Polymestor and his children, and (after a beautiful
ode on the last hours of Troy), they arrive. Polymestor
is induced to go with his little sons within the tent,
where they are slaughtered and he himself blinded. His
cries bring back Agamemnon, who rejects the pleas of
Polymestor. The Thracian, in his despair, prophesies the
strange end both of Agamemnon and of Hecuba. He
is dragged away, and the drama ends with preparations
for the voyage to Greece.</p>

<p>This tragedy, let it be said plainly, is on the whole
poor and uninteresting.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> It has been frequently noted,
for example, that the plot is “episodic,” that it falls into
two divisions, the story of Polyxena and the vengeance
upon Polymestor, which are really two small dramas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
with no genuine connexion. To this it has been replied
that the spiritual history of Hecuba supplies unity to the
whole; that these episodes bring out her development
from a victim into a fiend.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> But this is scarcely satisfactory.
For the two parts are developed so completely
along their several lines, they have so little dependence
upon one another, that they could stand apart; and that
is the real test. Further, the poet himself is uneasy.
He is anxious to make some sort of connexion, but it is
curiously adventitious. His device, that the corpse of
Polydorus is discovered by the woman sent for water
wherewith to bathe the body of Polyxena, has won too
high praise. An attempt to strengthen it, or rather to
draw attention to its neatness, is supplied in the conversation
between Hecuba and Agamemnon:<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> “How
did he die?” “By the hands of his Thracian host.” ...
“Who brought his body hither?” ... “This woman.
She found it upon the sea-shore.” “<i>Was she looking for
it, or busied with some other task?</i>” The last question is
absurd; Agamemnon has no reason to ask it. Other
little hooks,<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> less obtrusive than this, are provided here
and there to connect the two parts. If the play were an
unity they would not be needed.</p>

<p>Again, the favourite charge against Euripides, that
he delights in quasi-judicial disputes, is brought in here
also. The accusation is generally unfair. Critics have
been so eager to condemn this poet that they forget the
trial scene of the <i>Eumenides</i>, the altercation between
Œdipus and Creon in the <i>Œdipus at Colonus</i> and
various other passages in the earlier tragedians. If
a dispute occurs at all, it is in accordance with the
genius of Greek tragedy to set it out in formally opposed
speeches. One might as well complain of Hamlet’s soliloquies.
But in the <i>Hecuba</i> there is more than this. The
queen has a gusto not merely for eloquent appeals or
invective, but for self-conscious rhetoric, “Filled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
lament, not destitute of tears,”<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> is abominable. One is
not surprised to learn that the queen is interested in
professional teachers of rhetoric,<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> and one remembers
that Gorgias, the greatest of them, paid his first visit
to Athens a year or two<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> before this play was produced.</p>

<p>The whole piece in its tone and method is far below
the best of Euripides’ work. Certain things are
undoubtedly excellent—the famous chorus<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> already
mentioned, and above all the speech<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> of Polyxena and
the narrative of her death.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> The whole work has not
enough calibre. The pathos has no subtlety; the
characterization is machine-made; the style, though clear
and even elegant—one must allow that the first speech<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
of Polymestor, as a piece of conversational Greek, is
unobtrusively perfect—has remarkably few of those
feats<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> of idiom which delight us elsewhere.</p>

<p>Polyxena is charming, but a slight sketch only compared
with the Medea and the Phædra who have preceded
her. Agamemnon the cautious prince, Odysseus
the opportunist, Polymestor the brutally wicked barbarian,
are characters whom dozens of Euripides’ contemporaries
could have produced with ease. Talthybius the herald,
still more shadowy, claims remembrance by his naïve
conceit.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Hecuba herself is hardly better. True, the
poet has shown admirably how she progresses from weakness
to frightful strength under the pressure of injustice,
but without any very sympathetic psychology we fall
short of genuine tragedy and touch only melodrama.
And she is more than a little grotesque. Her strange
passion for rhetorical studies we have already noted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
She has, moreover, a taste for inopportune theorizing,<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
even concerning theology.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Her griefs themselves command
our respect, and she can in one or two flashes of
inspiration speak of them in language<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> not unworthy of
Shakespeare himself; but there is too much repetition
of merely melancholy adjectives, and though there should
be only one emotion in us towards a woman who has
lost all her children, we can hardly retain it when she
reminds us that they were fifty in number.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>The apparition of the murdered Polydorus is an
interesting element in the action. First, we view the
early part of the drama with greater sympathy for the
queen, knowing as we do the new horror which awaits
her. Secondly, it is necessary that Hecuba should
know how Polydorus died. Though but vaguely
affected by the vision at first,<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> when parts of it are fulfilled,
she remembers and believes definitely in the rest,
and knows that Polymestor is the murderer.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Andromache</span> (Ἀνδρομάχη) is perhaps the next<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
extant play in the order of time. It was not originally
brought out at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>The action takes place before the house of Neoptolemus,
prince of Phthia in Thessaly; at one side of the
orchestra is the shrine of Thetis. Andromache delivers
the prologue. After the fall of Troy she became the
prize of Neoptolemus to whom she has borne a son,
Molottus. Later the prince married Hermione, daughter
of the Spartan king Menelaus. Andromache has hidden
the child and herself taken sanctuary in the shrine of
Thetis; the boy’s father is from home, having gone to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
Delphi to ask Apollo’s pardon for demanding reparation
for Achilles’ death. Andromache now sends a fellow-slave
to ask the aid of Peleus, king of Phthia and her master’s
grandfather. Soon she is joined by the chorus, a company
of Phthian women who sympathize but urge submission.
Hermione enters, and after a spiteful altercation,
in which she tries in vain to make the captive leave her
sanctuary, departs with threats. Menelaus enters, leading
Molottus; he offers Andromache her choice: will
she submit to death, or see the boy slain? Andromache
gives herself up, whereupon Menelaus announces that,
while she must die, Molottus lies at the mercy of Hermione.
By this treachery Andromache is goaded into
the most bitter invective to be found in Euripides. The
chorus dwell upon the folly of domestic irregularities
such as those of Neoptolemus. Next Menelaus leads
forth Andromache and Molottus for death, when Peleus
hurries in and releases them. After a violent quarrel
Menelaus throws up his daughter’s cause and departs.
Peleus leads the captives away while the chorus sing his
youthful exploits. From the palace comes Hermione’s
nurse: deserted by her father and dreading her husband’s
vengeance the princess is seeking to destroy herself.
Next moment Hermione rushes out in distraction and
the nurse is attempting to calm her when Orestes enters,
explaining that he has called to inquire after his cousin
Hermione. She begs him to take her away to Menelaus
before her husband returns. Orestes agrees, reminding
her that she has in the past been betrothed to him; now
Neoptolemus shall pay for his insults by death at Delphi.
After their departure the chorus sing of the gods who
built but abandoned Troy, and of Orestes’ vengeance
upon Clytæmnestra. Peleus returns, having heard of
Hermione’s flight. In a moment arrives a messenger
who tells how Neoptolemus has been murdered by
Delphians at the instigation of Orestes. The body is
borne in, and Peleus laments over it until interrupted by
the goddess Thetis, his bride of long ago. She comforts
him with a promise of immortality. Andromache is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
marry Helenus, king of Molossia,<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> and her son is to be
ancestor of a dynasty in that land.</p>

<p>Certain remarkable difficulties in the plot must
be faced.</p>

<p>First is the breakdown of Menelaus in the presence
of Peleus. The first half of the play has exhibited
his unswerving resolve to destroy Andromache and
her child. Every conceivable argument save one has
been addressed to him in vain. That one argument
is physical compulsion, and Peleus certainly does not
offer it.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> After a storm of mutual abuse the Spartan
withdraws from the whole situation, muttering an excuse
which is scarcely meant to be taken seriously: he is
in a hurry to chastise an unfriendly state.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> He goes
just far enough to embitter his enemies to the utmost and
not far enough to redeem his threats; and he retires
without a word to his daughter after committing her to a
deeply dangerous project. Menelaus has faults, but crass
stupidity is not one of them; on the contrary he is
reviled as the type of base cunning. Why, then, does
he act with such utter futility at a crisis which anyone
could have foreseen?</p>

<p>In the second place, when was Neoptolemus
murdered? Orestes declares that the prince will be
slain at Delphi, and at once departs with Hermione.
After a choric song Peleus comes back, and almost at
once receives the news of his grandson’s death. When
Orestes utters his prophecy the messenger from Delphi
can hardly be more than a mile from the house. Has
he already committed the murder as a prelude to an
innocent and irrelevant pilgrimage to Dodona? And,
if so, why does he reveal, or rather not reveal, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
fact? And why has he risked himself in Phthia when
the news of his crime may at any moment be revealed?<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, there is a grave difficulty in the structure,
independent of Menelaus’ conduct and the dating of
Orestes’ crime. The play seems to fall into two halves
with but a slight connexion—the plight of Andromache
and the woes of Neoptolemus’ house.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Verrall’s theory<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> of the play explains
all these things together. Menelaus has come to see
that it is to his interest that his daughter should be the
wife of the Argive rather than of the Phthiote prince.
He and Orestes therefore concoct a plan to this end.
Two things must be achieved: Neoptolemus must be
removed, and Hermione, passionately as she loves
her lord, must be induced to accept his assassin. The
cunning of Menelaus fastens upon the failings of his
son-in-law as the path to success. First, he has offended
the Delphians, and thus Orestes finds it easy to compass
his death. Second, he has caused bitterness in his
own house by his connexion with Andromache. Menelaus,
while Orestes is at Delphi, urges Hermione into
action which her jealousy approves but which her
intellect (when it is allowed to speak) must and does
condemn. The Spartan has no intention of killing
the captives, but he sees to it that Hermione is, in
the eyes of Peleus and his subjects, irretrievably committed
to such an intention, which will beyond doubt
incense Neoptolemus most bitterly—or would, were
he still alive as Hermione supposes. Then, when
she has committed herself, he calmly bows to the outburst
of Peleus and leaves her ready to snatch at any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
hope in her hysterical despair. At this moment,
carefully awaited by the plotters, Orestes appears.
He has already murdered Neoptolemus, and is now
ready to take Hermione away. But this is not enough.
She must appear to come by her own suggestion, and
it must appear that she has known at the moment of
her elopement what has happened at Delphi. As she
hurries from the scene he utters, apparently in consolation
of her (though really she is out of hearing), so that
it may lodge in the minds of the chorus, a prophecy
of Neoptolemus’ fate. Later, she is to be reminded
by her father and her new suitor how completely she
is involved in suspicion of complicity. Thus she will
be thrown into the arms of Orestes, and whatever
blame there is will be laid upon Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>This view should in its essentials be adopted.
Every dramatist commits faults; but these apparent
faults in the <i>Andromache</i> prove too much. They tend
to show not that Euripides is here inferior in construction
and psychology to Sophocles, but that he
is insane. Few readers could compose a speech like
that of Andromache beginning ὦ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποισιν
ἔχθιστοι βροτῶν, or like the messenger’s narrative. But
we could all manage the exit of Menelaus better. There
is one great general objection to Verrall’s theory. Is
it not much too subtle? If readers have always missed
the point, would not spectators do so even more
certainly? Verrall, in answer, points to a passage in
the Greek <i>Argument</i>: τὸ δὲ δρᾶμα τῶν δευτέρων, which
he takes to mean “this play is one of the sequels”.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
He believes that the audience had a sufficient knowledge
of the earlier part of the story to follow the
<i>Andromache</i> with no perplexity. Whether this knowledge
was given by an earlier play of Euripides is
not of course certain, but may be regarded as likely.</p>

<p>We next note a feature of equal importance—the
atmosphere. Every reader observes strange anachronisms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
of sentiment and allusion—Hermione’s outburst<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
against women who destroy the confidence between
husband and wife, Peleus’ comments on Lacedæmonian
society,<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> and the like, which have no relevance to the
“Homeric age” of the Trojan war. But the whole
tone of the play is unheroic; even if these special
features were removed it would remain quite unlike
a Sophoclean drama. Euripides has, in fact, written
a play about his own generation with a definite purpose.
He takes stories from myths as the foundation of his
plays, but his interest is in his own time. In spite of
“thy mother Helen” and “the hapless town of the
Phrygians,” his work concerns essentially fifth-century
Athenians. Hence the almost complete absence of
poetic colour, which is only found in the conventional
lyrics and the goddess of the epilogue, who is no more
in tune with the rest of the piece than a fairy-queen
would be at the close of <i>A Doll’s House</i>. His chief
concern is the danger to family life involved in the
practice of slave-holding. Neoptolemus loses his life,
and Hermione consents to the wreck of her own
happiness, simply because of Andromache’s position in
the home. She is the fulcrum which the astute villains
employ; without her Hermione would never have
been manageable.</p>

<p>In harmony with this realistic spirit is the character-drawing.
None of the personages is of heroic stature,
but all are amazingly real, however disagreeable. The
two conspirators, Menelaus and Orestes, of course, do not
reveal their natures plainly. The latter, as far as this
incident alone is concerned, might strike one as almost
featureless; but there cling to him significant little
fragments from the earlier history of Hermione. A
sinister faithfulness actuates him. In spite of his repulse
he has not forgotten his affection for Hermione, not even
her last words of renunciation.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Nor has he ceased to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
brood on the insults of Neoptolemus—perhaps nothing
in the play is more effective than the gloomy triumph
with which he flings back the hated word: “and the
matricide shall teach thee”.... Menelaus, as a
study in successful villainy combined with the domestic
virtues, is quite perfect in his kind; <i>ces pères de famille
sont capables de tout</i>. But it is upon the three victims,
Hermione, Andromache, and Peleus, that the poet has
lavished his skill most notably. Each has precisely the
virtues and the failings which are fit to make them
answer with the precision of machinery to each string
pulled by the Spartan diplomatist. Peleus may be
relied upon to provide Menelaus with an excuse for
retiring when he wishes, and to utter wild language
which can be used to prove that he is responsible for
Hermione’s flight.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Andromache, earning and receiving
our pity for her past woes and her present anguish, yet
alienates us by her arrogance and a certain metallic
brutality in repartee and invective which again are
invaluable to the men whose puppet she is. That she
should not cower before Hermione or her father is natural,
but that is not the point; her trampling tactlessness<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> is
a positive disease. She is indeed (except in her love
for Molottus) as callous as Menelaus. This is a point
of absolutely fundamental import. That interview
early in the play, which might have been priceless to
both women, ends only in the hopeless embitterment
of Hermione. The latter is the best-drawn character
of all. Swayed by strong primitive impulses, jealousy
and fear, without any balance of mind or emotion,
curiously liable to accept the domination of a stronger
personality, she is fatally suited to the machinations of
her father. When she first appears, it is fairly plain
that she has come to suggest a compromise to Andromache.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
What she wishes is not blood, but servility.
Spiteful and vulgar, she cannot forgive the captive for
the effortless dignity which she has inherited from Trojan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
kings. Hers is no vision of a murdered rival: how petty
yet how horribly natural it is—she wishes to see Andromache
scrubbing the floor!<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> But vulgar and spiteful
as she is, the princess can be wrought upon, as the later
part of the action shows, and if only to self-respect
Andromache had added tact and sympathy Hermione
would have been her passionate friend before thirty
lines had been spoken. The pathos of the scene lies
above all in the misunderstanding which pits the two
women against one another, where they should have
combined against the callous craft which was using them
both for the ends of politics.</p>

<p>The deities whom we find in this play need detain
us only a moment. Thetis is no more than sweetening
for the popular taste. Soothing and beautiful as are
her consolations to the aged sufferer, such a personage
has no real concern with a drama so utterly secular.
As for Apollo, it is here plainer than usual that his name
is nothing but a convenient short term for the great
priestly organization at Delphi. That there is a genuine
divine person who has aided Orestes and punished
Neoptolemus we cannot believe. The only touch of
religious awe to be found lies in the messenger’s report.
When the assassins are fleeing before their courageous
victim, “from the midst of the shrine some one raised
an awful voice whereat the hair stood up, and rallied
the host again to fight”.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> It is this same speaker,
however, who thus sums up his account of the whole
event: “And thus hath he that gives oracles to others,
he who for all mankind is the judge of righteousness,
thus hath he entreated the son of Achilles who offered
him amends. Like a man that is base hath he remembered
an ancient grudge. How, then, can he be wise?”
To the simple Thessalian confronted for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
with doubts of Olympian justice, such phrasing is natural.
For Euripides the conclusion is that Apollo does not
exist at all. “Apollo” does not take vengeance upon
the blasphemer at the time of his offence, but waits
unaccountably till his second visit, when he comes to
make amends and when by an accident, fortunate for
the god, a conspiracy of villainous men happens to make
his enemy their victim.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>In keeping with all this is the literary tone of the
work. The lyrics are of little interest to a reader,
though one<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> of them markedly sums up the situation
and forces home the moral. For the rest, the dialogue
is utterly unheroic and unpoetical but splendidly vigorous,
terse, and idiomatic; in this respect the <i>Andromache</i>
is equal to the best work of Euripides. Could anything
of its kind be more perfect than the first speech
of Hermione<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>—this mixture of pathetic heart-hunger,
of childish snobbery and petulance, this terribly familiar
instinct to cast in the teeth of the unfortunate precisely
those things for which one formerly envied them, these
scraps of ludicrously inaccurate slander against “barbarians”
picked up from the tattle of gossiping slaves,
and the heavy preachments about “the marriage-question”
which cry aloud their origin from the lips of
Menelaus? In</p>

<p>For readers who admire exclusively the Sophoclean
type of play, the <i>Andromache</i> is a painful experience to
be forgotten as soon as possible. For any who find
interest in the behaviour of ordinary beings at a great
testing moment, this work is an endless delight.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hercules Furens</span><a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> or <i>Mad Heracles</i> (Ἡρακλῆς
Μαινόμενος) is perhaps the next play in order of time.
Most critics place it about the year 420 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> or a little
earlier; the chief reason for this is the celebrated chorus
about old age—it is natural supposition that the poet
had recently passed beyond the military age, and so
would now be just over sixty.</p>

<p>The scene is laid before the house of Heracles at
Thebes. Amphitryon, reputed father of the hero, explains
the situation. Heracles, leaving his wife Megara
and his three sons with Amphitryon, has departed to
Hades in quest of Cerberus. In his absence one
Lycus has seized the throne and intends to murder
Heracles’ family. Megara would submit, but Amphitryon
still hopes for Heracles’ return. Certain aged
Thebans, who form the chorus, arrive, followed by
Lycus who, after sneers at Heracles, orders his henchmen
to burn his victims in their house. Megara begs
of Lycus that they be given time to array themselves
for death. He consents, and the sufferers retire.
Lycus departs, and soon the sad procession returns.
Suddenly Heracles himself enters. He tells that he
has brought back Cerberus and released Theseus, King
of Athens, from the lower world; he promises to destroy
Lycus and goes within. A splendid ode laments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the weakness of old age but glorifies the Muses. Lycus
returns, enters the house, and is slain; the chorus greet
his yells with delight and hail Heracles as now proved
the son of Zeus. Suddenly Iris and Frenzy sweep
down from the sky, sent by Hera to drive Heracles
mad. Frenzy herself is reluctant, but enters the house,
and the chorus raise cries of horror, amid which the
house totters in ruin. A messenger relates how
Heracles, after slaying Lycus, has been seized with madness
and destroyed his wife and children. The eccyclema
shows the hero sunk in stupor. He awakes and, realizing
his situation, meditates suicide, but Theseus arrives and
wins him back to courage; after terrible outbursts
against Heaven he departs to live with Theseus in
Athens.</p>

<p>After a cursory reading of this play one’s impressions
are doubtful. Many features excite warm admiration,
such as the superb lyric<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> on old age, the speeches<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
of Megara about her fatherless boys, Heracles’ replies<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
to Theseus; even the wrangle between Lycus and
Amphitryon is full of idiomatic vigour.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> But to be
blunt, what is the play about? It works up to a climax
in the deliverance of Amphitryon and his kin, and then
begins again. Long before the close we have forgotten
Lycus. We feel that the play is structureless, or
(which is worse) that it falls so clearly into two dramas
that we cannot view it as a single piece of art. But if
we seriously seek for unity, we naturally look for it in
the fortunes of Heracles himself. This granted, we
shall expect to find that the incident which in a bare
summary seems to disjoint the whole is specially treated.
Looking then at the incursion of Lycus, we find that at
every moment the events are considered from the point of
view of Heracles, in terms of his actions, and the sentiments
which cling to his personality. We are only
prevented from seeing this at first by the modern supposition
that the culmination of a tragedy is the death of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
a leading person, not a spiritual crisis. The discussion
between Amphitryon and Megara about instant submission
is dominated by despair of the hero’s return in the
latter’s mind and by hope of it in the former’s. As soon as
Lycus arrives, he asks: “What hope, what defence find
ye against death? Believe ye that the father of these
lads, he who lies in Hades, will return?” Whereupon
he proceeds to a long tirade in abuse of the hero, and
Amphitryon’s even more garrulous response deals
almost solely with his son’s achievements and the gratitude
which he merits from Thebes and Greece. As the
doomed party go indoors the old man reminds Heaven
itself of the help it owes to Heracles, and the following
lyrics are an elaborate chronicle of his marvellous
exploits. Finally, when at point to die, Megara in a
beautifully natural manner turns her farewell to her sons
into a painful memory of the plans which their father
used to make for them. In this way the danger of his
family is considered as a test of Heracles’ powers and
greatness. Will he make good the promise of his past
glories? Will he return and free them from Lycus?</p>

<p>Dr. Verrall<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> follows this line of thought, giving to
it far greater precision and colour. He believes that
the subject of this play is the miraculous tone investing
the traditional stories about Heracles. According to
popular belief in the poet’s day, Heracles was a son of
Zeus; he performed many exploits which were definitely
superhuman, culminating in a descent to Hades and
return therefrom. These stories are untrue. The play
indicates this simply and directly, giving, however, most
attention to the method by which they won credence.
In a primitive civilization, when men had not yet attained
to clear thinking, remarkable but human feats
like those of Heracles were extolled as miraculous by the
uncritical. Such are Amphitryon and the chorus, who
when challenged by Lycus are capable only of violent
reiteration of their belief, but offer, and can offer, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
proof that the miracles happened. It is a curious
symptom of the former’s vague credulity that while
loving and defending Heracles as his own son, he yet
claims<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> the help of Zeus on the ground that the god is
himself Heracles’ father. The Theban elders join<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> in
this irrational belief—as soon as it appears that the divine
parentage is established by the return from Hades,
which even if true would of course have nothing to do
with the question. It is in such minds as this that belief
in the miraculous life of Heracles first sprang up. But
this belief rests largely upon the accounts of his adventures
given by Heracles himself; thus we come to
the heart of the tragedy, the mental condition of the
hero.</p>

<p>Near the end he exclaims against the consolations of
Theseus: “Alas! such words as thine are too trivial for
my sorrows. I think not that the gods love unlawful
unions, and that they put chains upon one another is a
belief I never held nor will I ever. God, if he be God,
in truth needs naught. These are but poets’ wretched
tales.”<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Plainly, the sober and reasonable speech which
begins thus repudiates the highly-coloured but pernicious
stories of tradition to which Theseus has just appealed.
Heracles believes in one God utterly above human
weaknesses. Then what of Zeus’ love of Alcmena, the
jealousy of Hera, the whole basis of his suffering as conceived
by the orthodox? And what of his own semi-divine
nature, the foundation again of his superhuman
deeds? They are delusions. Heracles is no demi-god;
his exploits, however great and valuable, are in no sense
miraculous. This view, moreover, is precisely that
which we ought to gain from the early part of the
drama. Lycus is no doubt an insolent bully, but would
certainly not brave annihilation (whether at the hands
of Zeus or of his son) by slaughtering a demi-god’s
family. That he acts so proves that he does not believe
in the divine parentage of Heracles; and the support so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
readily given by Thebes to his policy shows as plainly
that to the mass of citizens no real proofs of superhuman
nature have been offered. In brief, the actions and
language of every one in the play except Heracles himself,
Amphitryon, and the chorus—of every one, including
Theseus and even Megara, imply that in this play
Heracles is indeed a person of note, but an “eminent
man” of no very startling eminence.</p>

<p>But the hero himself long before this repudiation of
“poets’ wretched tales” has himself given them authority.
He tells his father that in truth he has visited Hades,
dragged Cerberus thence, and rescued Theseus. At
many places<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> in the drama he refers without misgiving
or query to legendary monsters which he has quelled,
and to his safe return from Hades. This inconsistency,
according to Dr. Verrall, is the root of the drama.
Heracles suffers from a growing tendency to madness;
in his sane moods he knows that all his story is human, all
the nobler for its humanity, but in his dark hours he accepts
the vulgar splendours which rumour throws round his
adventures, at such times lending nascent myth the support
of his own false witness. The tragedy of his life
has been this mental distemper, which has finally caused
him to destroy his wife and children. It appears in
dreadful paroxysms throughout the first speech which he
addresses to Theseus—first an attempt to account for
his murderous outbreak by an account of purely human
events; then inconsistently a reference to Zeus’ fatherhood
and the attempt of Hera upon his infant life,
followed by a splendidly vigorous catalogue of legendary
deeds, Typhos, the giants, and the rest, culminating with
despairing comments on his hopeless guilt and on the
complete victory of Hera; then he suddenly rends the
goddess with his scorn: “to such a deity who would
pray?—for a jealous quarrel she has destroyed the guiltless
benefactor of Greece”.</p>

<p>Two important details should be noted in connexion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
with this theory. First the apparition<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> of Iris and
Frenzy seems to overthrow it utterly by a demonstration
in presence of the audience that Heracles’ afflictions
are caused by Hera. But the past scene, before ever
Frenzy arrives, has shown the hero, if not mad, yet not
in full possession of his senses.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Moreover, she is not
seen by him at the moment when he goes mad, yet, if
the chorus see her, <i>a fortiori</i> she should be visible when
attacking her victim himself; again the scene in which
the fiend herself shows kind-hearted scruples, is ludicrous.
These personages (Verrall suggests) are a dream
beheld by a member of the chorus who has been
impressed by what he has already seen of Heracles’
malady. This is proved by an absence of allusion to the
event afterwards when the fatal incident is discussed,
and when silence is incredible. The aged man (or men)
will gradually remember the dream afterwards; this is
another way in which stories like that of Hera’s vengeance
obtain currency.</p>

<p>The second point arises from the conversation between
Theseus and his friend when clearly sane. Does
he confirm the story of the visit to Hades? Now,
Heracles and he several times refer to his rescue “from
below,” but never do they use language which necessarily
refers to Hades. “Thou didst bring me back safe to
the light from the dead (or corpses)”<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>—such is the style
of allusion. Undoubtedly the language can be applied
to Hades; undoubtedly also it could fit some natural
event like a disaster in a cave or mine which may
actually have been suggested<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> by rationalists of the day
as an explanation of the myth—a suggestion which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
poet is inclined to adopt and for which therefore he
leaves room in his phraseology.</p>

<p>Theseus, amiable as he is, yet presents little of interest;
it is his function to voice the opinions of the
normal unimaginative man. Megara, however, of whom
little has been said, deserves sympathetic study. She
does not share Amphitryon’s extraordinary beliefs about
his son,<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> but loves and admires him with an affection
beautifully expressed throughout the too brief portion
of the drama in which she appears; it is she who long
before the other realizes his mental state.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> In her, too,
poetical imagination shines forth with a radiance which
surpasses the charm of the lyrics and Heracles’ impetuous
eloquence. It is she who utters the Sophoclean
description<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> of sovereignty:—</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and that expression<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> of her yearning grief which in its

<p>The <span class="smcap">Supplices</span><a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> (Ἱκετίδες), or <i>Suppliant Women</i>, is
generally supposed on internal evidence<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> to have been
produced about 420 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The Suppliants, who form the chorus, are the
mothers of the Seven who attacked Thebes and their
attendants. They surround Æthra, mother of Theseus,
the Athenian king, and beg her to win his aid for them,
since the Thebans have refused burial to the slain.
Theseus at first refuses, but Æthra persuades him. A
Theban herald enters to forbid Theseus, in the name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
the Theban king Creon, to aid the Suppliants. Theseus
rejects this behest and prepares for war. After an ode,
news comes of the Athenian victory. The remains of
five heroes are brought in (of the other two, Amphiaraus
was swallowed up by the earth and Polynices is supposed
still at Thebes). Adrastus delivers funeral speeches over
them. The obsequies now take place. The body of
Capaneus is burned separately, and Evadne his wife
throws herself upon his pyre despite the entreaties of her
father Iphis. The young sons of the chieftains bear in
the funeral urns, and Adrastus promises that Argos will
cherish undying gratitude towards Athens. The goddess
Athena appears and bids Theseus exact an oath
to this effect; she comforts the fatherless boys with a
promise of vengeance.</p>

<p>This drama is perhaps the least popular and the least
studied of all Greek plays, which is not surprising when
one considers that, in spite of the praise merited by
certain parts, the whole work considered by really
dramatic standards is astonishingly bad. There is no
character-drawing worth the name, and though it may
be said that the real heroine of the drama is Athens,<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> it
is still strange to find Euripides contented with such
colourless persons as Theseus, Æthra, and indeed all
the characters. Still more striking are the irrelevancies.
Theseus’ address<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> to Adrastus and the assembly at large
concerning the blessings conferred by Heaven upon man,
have hardly a semblance of connexion with the urgent
and painful subject of debate. Even more otiose, and
far longer, is the dispute<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> between Theseus and the
herald on the claims of monarchy and democracy.
The scene of Evadne’s <i>suttee</i>, however striking, is
dramatically unjustifiable; it is an episode in the bad
sense meant by Aristotle—no integral part of the action.
The last scene is spoiled by the intervention of Athena,
who merely causes the Argives to give an oath instead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
of a simple promise that they will ever be loyal friends
of Athens. That this intervention corresponds to very
definite historical fact (the league between the two states
in 420 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> brought about by Alcibiades) makes no difference
to the æsthetic fact. None the less one notes in
the <i>Supplices</i> certain excellent features. The appeal<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> of
Æthra to her son, and the lyric dirge of Evadne over
her husband’s pyre, are admirably composed. Several
parts of the work are magnificent as spectacle—the
opening in which the sorrowing mothers, Adrastus, and
the fatherless boys are grouped about the aged queen,
the return of Theseus and his troops with the dead
bodies, the episode of Evadne as it struck the eye,<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> and
the procession of boys carrying the funeral urns.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ion</span><a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> (Ἴων) is a play of uncertain date, but was
probably produced late in Euripides’ life; some would
place it as low as 413 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The scene is laid before the temple at Delphi.
Hermes tells how the Athenian princess Creusa, owing
to the violence of Apollo, bore a child, which Hermes
brought to Delphi, where the boy grew up as a temple-attendant.
Later Creusa married Xuthus, and to-day
they will come to ask the oracle some remedy for their
childlessness. Apollo will give Ion to Xuthus as the
latter’s son; later he is to be made known to Creusa
as her own. Ion enters, and in a beautiful song expresses
his joy in the service of Apollo. The chorus
(attendants of Creusa) draw near; they converse with
Ion and admire the temple façade. Creusa arrives; she
and Ion are mutually attracted, and she tells how “a
friend,” having borne a child to Apollo and exposed it,
wishes to know whether it still lives. Ion rejects the
story, and urges her not to put such a question to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
oracle. Xuthus now appears, and goes within to
consult the god; Creusa retires, while Ion muses on
the immorality of gods. After a choric ode Xuthus
returns and greets Ion as his son: the oracle has
declared that the first man to meet him will be his
offspring. Ion asks who is his mother; they agree that
she must be some Delphian Bacchante. The youth is
dismayed at the prospect of quitting Delphi for Athens,
but Xuthus genially bids him prepare a farewell banquet
for his friends, and departs to offer sacrifice upon
Parnassus. The Athenian women express their consternation:
Athens is to have an alien ruler and Creusa
must remain childless. When she returns they tell
her the news, and in bitter disappointment she breaks
into an agonized recital of her old sorrow. An aged
male attendant undertakes to murder Ion by poison at
the banquet. Creusa consents. After an ode praying
for vengeance, a messenger brings news that the plot
has failed and Creusa has been condemned to death.
The queen hurries in, pursued by Ion and a mob; she
takes refuge on the altar. Bitter reproaches pass
between the two till the Pythian prophetess appears;
giving Ion the basket in which he was discovered as a
babe, and which still contains the articles then found
with him, she bids him seek his mother. Creusa greets
him as her son and names the three objects. They
embrace with joy, but Ion, learning that not Xuthus but
Apollo is his father, determines to ask the oracle which
account is true. Athena, however, appears and explains
that Apollo has been compelled to change his plans;
Xuthus must continue to believe Ion his own son.</p>

<p>This drama suggests a rich tasselled robe of gorgeous
embroidery; were it not that the basis of the story is
so painfully sexual, the <i>Ion</i> would be perhaps the most
popular of Greek plays. The sudden changes of situation,
the emotional crises, the sheer thrill of many
passages, the lovely study of the Greek Samuel at his
holy tasks—all these things make a glorious play. But
our delight is blurred by a recurrent perplexity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Theology is obtruded throughout, and such a theology
as never was.</p>

<p>Apollo ravishes Creusa and by help of Hermes
brings her child to Delphi, where he lives happily up to
manhood, but Creusa is allowed to suppose her child
destroyed by wild beasts. The god, however, intends to
secure Ion his rights as prince of Athens. Xuthus is to
accept the lad as his son, while Creusa and Ion are to be
made secretly known to each other. But this plan is
disturbed by the Athenian women, and the god, revising
his intention, sends the doves to save Ion, and the
prophetess to save Creusa. All would now be well,
since both Xuthus and the queen accept Ion as a son.
But Ion wishes to know whether the oracle speaks truth
or lies.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Apollo therefore sends Athena to prevent him
from taxing the oracle with inconsistency. She explains
the various activities of Apollo, prophesies concerning
the Athenian race, and bids Creusa keep Xuthus in
ignorance.</p>

<p>Apollo is as much fool<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> as knave.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Athena may
say that “Apollo hath done all things well,”<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> but mortals
will not endorse her sisterly admiration. Even the
revised plan cannot succeed. How long will Xuthus
remain ignorant of facts which are being proclaimed,
not only to Creusa and her son, but also to the crowd
of Delphians and the Athenian women? Even if this
could be secured, things are no better: Apollo has said
both that he himself, and that Xuthus, is the father of
Ion. Which of these statements is true matters comparatively
little. One of them must be a lie. The god
who gives oracles to Greece is a trickster, and no celestial
consolations or Athenian throne can compensate the
youth for the loss of what filled his heart only this
morning.</p>

<p>The <i>Ion</i> is the one play in which Euripides attacks
the Olympian theology beyond all conceivable doubt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
It is certain (i) that he does not believe in the existence
of Apollo and Hermes; (ii) that the Delphic oracle is a
human institution making impossible pretensions; and
(iii) that his method of attack is by innuendo and implication.
Verrall’s theory of the poet’s method is here
on absolutely unassailable ground. The story is purely
human, and the theological story is a mere addendum
designed to suit the religious occasion and many of the
spectators. What, then, is this human story? Verrall
explains that Creusa was wronged by some man unknown,
and that her child perished. The Pythian
priestess bore<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> a child which she reared with a natural
tenderness.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> This child was Ion, whom the managers
of the shrine determined to place in a station which could
assist their influence. Then occurs the deadly scene in
which the youth is about to kill Creusa. To save the
Delphians from the responsibility of murdering a foreign
queen in the open street, and the boy from conduct
which would make his admission to Athens impossible,
a plot is hastily concocted. It will prevent war with
Athens, it will destroy Creusa’s hatred for Ion, and
secure his future throne. The priests have already heard,
even if Apollo has not, the story shrieked<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> out at him by
Creusa. By an impudent master-stroke they determine
that Ion shall be the queen’s long-lost child. To this
end the history of the two persons supplies most of the
means; all that is needed is something tangible to tie
the knot. Hurriedly the clues are provided. The
necklace exposed long ago upon the babe is an easy
matter; its fellow was found upon the person of the
Pædagogus.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> The ever-blooming olive of the Acropolis
can be equalled in freshness by sprays plucked to-day in
Delphi; and for the embroidery, it is fairly certain that
some such covering must have been wrapped round the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
child, and its pattern is sufficiently vague.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> The queen
in her heart-hunger and peril snatches at these clues,
and in a moment the two fall into one another’s arms.
Finally, the clear-headed persistence of Ion is met by
what may in truth be called a <i>dea ex machina</i>.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Over
the temple façade is protruded the gigantic head<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> of a
figure, through which some one offers such fumbling
“explanations” as are possible. All this is enough for
Creusa—she has a son. As for Ion, whose life has
been in his faith, he commits himself to nothing; in one
day he has grown to the full stature of a man, but one
hardly supposes that he visited Delphi again. Thus
may Verrall’s theory be summarized. It has never been
answered, nor does it seem possible to make any answer,
except that the alleged real story is “far-fetched”—of
course; for any rationalistic explanation of a supposed
miracle must be strange, otherwise no one would have
hitherto believed the miracle in order to account for the
facts.</p>

<p>The “theological background” then being merely
theatrical gauze and canvas, what of the human action?
Though it forms an extraordinarily brilliant, powerful,
fascinating spectacle, is it a tragedy?—the story ends
with the appearance at any rate of joy and contentment.
Yet tragedy is found not only in the death of the body
but in the death of ideals; and the destruction of Ion’s
faith in his all-knowing unerring father is a fate from
which, when we remember his happy carolling upon the
dawn-lit temple-steps, we could wish to see him saved
even by the Gorgon’s venom. Any out-cry wherewith
he might have challenged Creusa’s is checked by the cold
disgust which fills him at the sound of Athena’s bland
periods; but one knows the kind of man Athens will
receive to-morrow—one who will agree with Xuthus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
that “these things don’t happen,”<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> who will be an
admirable connoisseur of party politics,<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> but who has lost
his vision. This, then, is spiritually, though not technically,
a tragedy. Further, it is technically a melodrama.
That is, the external form and texture is calculated to
produce not as in tragedy simple, profound, and enduring
exaltation, but more superficial, violent, and transitory
emotion. The Pædagogus is pure melodrama, witness
his change from senile helplessness<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> to ruthless vigour,<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
the wildness of his suggestions—“burn down the
temple” ... “murder your husband”; the utter absence
of remorse and secondary interests, characteristic
of villainous subordinates in melodrama; his complete
breakdown when it is demanded by the plot.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Such also
is the confrontation of Ion and Creusa with the terrified
women and scowling Delphians as a background. But
the finest thrill, and the touch least justified by any
standards save those of melodrama, occurs in the speech
of Ion as he stands with the fateful basket in his arms
and determines not to open it but to dedicate it to Apollo.
The next moment he reflects that he must carry out the
god’s will and discover his origin. The genuine plot
halts so as to cause theatrical sensation.</p>

<p>It is natural in such a play that the characterization
should be simple. Xuthus, the Pædagogus, and the
Prophetess, are scarcely more than foils to the two
chief persons. Creusa attracts us rather because the
poet has so well portrayed woman than because he
has created a particular woman. More than this can
be said of Ion. He is marked out from all the other
persons of this play by sheer intelligence, by the power
of facing facts, and of constantly readjusting his perspective.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>
He is a figure of somewhat quaint pathos.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
The happy child who sings to the birds on the temple-steps
and thinks of nothing but his tranquil existence
of pious routine, turns in a moment to the discreet
adviser who can imagine incredible things: “There
is no man who will transmit to thee response to such
a question. For were he in his own house proved
a villain, Phœbus would justly wreak mishap upon
him that gave thee such reply.”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> As he moves to
and fro, filling the holy-water stoups, we can hear him
murmuring to himself serene blasphemies. “But I must
blame Phœbus. Such conduct! Use violence upon
maidens, and betray them? Beget children in secret
and leave them to die? Come, come! Since you
have the power, remember its responsibility. You
punish mankind for wrong-doing” ...<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> and so forth,
including the suggestion that if Zeus, Poseidon, and
Apollo were compelled to pay damages for their
lustful offences, their temples would become bankrupt.
In politics, as in religion, Ion observes and
deduces for himself. Athenian public life he well
understands before entering it;<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> he has views about
the influence of perverted religious feelings upon
public opinion and the execution of the law.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> All this
prepares us for the splendid moment<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> when forgetting
his own rule<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> he insists on bearding the oracle, and
for the reception he gives to the patching-up of Apollo’s
infallibility.</p>

<p>For the rest, the work is a study of emotions deeply
conceived and wonderfully expressed. Creusa is induced
to tell her story, though disguised, to Ion largely
by her sudden feeling for the youth himself.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> The
revelation which she makes to the Pædagogus and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
the chorus is wrung from her after all these years by
the sudden loneliness which the gift of a son to her
husband brings upon her heart. And the gloriously
successful climax<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> where she suddenly addresses her
executioner as her son is purely emotional also. Even
the intellectual revolt of Ion is introduced by a sudden
turn of the feelings in the recognition-scene: “Mother,
let my father, too, share in our joy”.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Troades</span><a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> (Τρῳάδες), or <i>Trojan Women</i>, was
produced in 415 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> together with <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Palamedes</i>,
and <i>Sisyphus</i> as satyric play. This group
obtained the second prize, being defeated by the work
of Xenocles “whoever he is”.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>The action takes place outside Troy after its capture;
in the background is a tent wherein are captive
Trojan women. Before the tent lies Hecuba in a
stupor of grief. The deities Poseidon and Athena
explain in a dialogue that they are quitting Troy with
reluctance; Poseidon will destroy the Greek fleet
on its way home. When they have departed, Hecuba
stirs and laments; soon she is joined by the chorus
of Trojan women. Talthybius tells her that Cassandra
is to become the concubine of Agamemnon; concerning
Polyxena he speaks evasively; Andromache is given
to Neoptolemus, Hecuba herself to Odysseus, whom
she detests above all Greeks. Cassandra rushes
forward uttering in frenzy a horrible parody of a
marriage-song in her own honour; she prophesies the
woes of Agamemnon and Odysseus. Hecuba ponders
her former greatness and present misery; the chorus
sing the fatal day when Troy welcomed the Wooden
Horse. Andromache and her infant Astyanax are
brought in, and from her Hecuba hears Polyxena’s
death. Though prostrated by grief she urges Andromache
to please her new lord, that perchance his son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
may revive something of Troy’s greatness. Talthybius
returns with tidings that Astyanax is to be hurled from
the battlements. After an ode on the first siege of
Troy, Menelaus enters rejoicing in his long-deferred
opportunity of slaying Helen. Hecuba bursts into
rapturous thanks to the Power which rules mankind,
and when Helen pleads innocence refutes her bitterly.
Talthybius brings in the mangled body of Astyanax
over which Hecuba utters a speech of reproachful
lament. The play ends with the burning of Troy.</p>

<p>In structure archaic, this play is in spirit something
quite new to the Attic stage. On the one hand there
is little unfolding of a plot; we are reminded strongly
of the <i>Prometheus</i> by the portrayal of a situation which
changes with extreme slowness. It is the manner of
this portrayal which is new and terrible. The <i>Troades</i>
was performed after the sack of Melos and before
the departure of the Sicilian expedition; it is a statement,
by a member of the nation which annihilated
Melos, of the horrors wherewith the vanquished are
overwhelmed. The glory won by the Greeks who
overthrew Troy was the best-known and most cherished
gift of tradition. Now a Greek writer reveals the
other side of conquest. After the crime of Melos,
Euripides never felt as he had felt towards Athens
or Greece. His intellect and his heart were appalled
by the cold ferocity of which his fellows showed themselves
every year more capable. Hitherto he has
attacked the evils of human nature; now he impeaches
one definite nation, and that his own. No spectator
could doubt that “Troy” is Melos, “the Greeks”
Athens. Such uncompromising hostility must have
produced deep effects on so impressionable an assembly.
For it is not merely a denunciation; it is a threat.
The poet takes the whole picture of misery and stupid
tyranny, and puts it into sinister perspective in his
prologue. All the cruelties of the play are committed
by the Greeks under shadow of the calamity denounced
against them by the deities of the prologue, whereof<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
we are again and again reminded by the sentences
casually dropped by Talthybius and others, that the
host is eager to embark. And this when the great
Athenian armament was itself thronging the Peiræus
in preparation for the voyage to Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>Of characterization, therefore, little is to be found.
Cassandra, though her pathos is less deep and wide
than that of her namesake in the <i>Agamemnon</i>, is yet
valuable, as aiding in that perspective which is given
mainly by the prologue. Talthybius and Andromache
are ably sketched, but Menelaus and Helen are introduced
merely for the sake of the elaborate dispute
between Hecuba and Helen. It is upon Hecuba that
the whole poem hangs—not upon her action or even
her character, but upon her capacity for suffering. With
the progress of the play she changes from the Queen
of Troy to a figure summing up in herself all the sorrows
of humanity. As each woe is faced, lamented, and at last
assimilated into an ennobling experience, another disaster
flings her back into the primitive outcry to begin once
more the task of resignation. She is a pagan <i>mater
dolorosa</i>. As each billow of grief descends upon her,
leaving her still sentient, nay, filled with eager sympathy
for others, the Greeks who oppress her become strangely
puny and unreal like the legionaries in some mediæval
picture of martyrdom. Even when she confesses to
complete despair she yet the next moment begins to
fashion within the abyss a tiny abode for hope: Astyanax
may grow to manhood, “so that—if chance is kind—sons
of thy blood may dwell again in Ilium, and there
might yet be a city”.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Next moment the child is torn
away to be flung from the battlements. Even so,
Hecuba recovers her balance in the end and can deliver,
as she stands over the little body, the stinging reproach<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>
of a “barbarian” revolted by the crimes of “civilization”.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
It is to this endless capacity for facing sorrow and transmuting
it into rich experience that we owe one of the
most beautiful and definite philosophic <i>dicta</i> to be found
in Euripides:—</p>

<p class="noindent">“O Throne of earth, by earth upheld, whosoe’er Thou
art, beyond conjecture of our knowledge—Zeus, or the
law of Nature, or the mind of Man, to Thee do I
address my prayer; for moving along Thy soundless

for the Olympian gods, they are scarcely attacked;
there is little more than a jaded recognition that belief
in them is no help or inspiration.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> To this plaintive
agnosticism there is here no alternative but fierce
pessimism, as when in the frightful eloquence of Hecuba
we are told that Fate is “a capering idiot”.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>Most mournful of all Greek tragedies, this is yet
beautiful, and full of splendid spectacular effects: Cassandra
bounding wildly forth with her bridal torches; the
entry of Andromache seated in the waggon among the
spoils of Troy; Hecuba bending over Astyanax’ body
within the great buckler of his father; the little procession
which carries the shield to burial, princely robes hanging
therefrom; and the aged queen addressing her farewell
to the blazing city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iphigenia in Tauris</span><a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> (Ἰφιγένεια ἡ ἐν Ταύροις) or
<i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i>, is a work of uncertain
date.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> Nothing is known of its success when produced,
and the absence of scholia suggests that it was not
popular in later times.</p>

<p>Iphigenia, before the temple of Artemis among the
Taurians (in South Russia), relates that she was not
slain at Aulis, but brought by Artemis to serve as her
priestess here, close to the city of King Thoas, where
she is compelled to sacrifice all strangers. A dream has
suggested to her that her brother Orestes is dead; she
goes within to prepare offerings to his shade. Orestes
and Pylades enter; they have been sent by the Delphian
oracle to steal the image of Artemis; in this way
Orestes will be freed from the Furies. They postpone
their attempt till nightfall, and retire. The chorus of
Greek captive maidens enter in attendance upon
Iphigenia, and a cowherd brings news that two Greeks
have been captured and are being brought for sacrifice.
After a choric ode, the rustics enter with their prisoners.
A conversation follows, in which neither Iphigenia’s
name nor that of Orestes is revealed, and she offers to
spare his life if he will take a letter to Argos. He insists
that Pylades shall go, and the latter asks that the
message be read. It proves to be an appeal to Orestes,
and, exclaiming that he will at once perform his task,
Pylades hands it to his friend. Brother and sister thus
become known to one another, and all three agree to
escape, taking the image with them. They enter the
temple, after Iphigenia has enjoined secrecy upon the
chorus, who sing their yearning for home. King Thoas
enters and is tricked by Iphigenia into aiding the escape.
The chorus sing Apollo’s conquest of Delphi. A messenger
rushes in, seeking Thoas; the chorus misdirect him,
but in vain. Thoas learns how his people have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
beguiled into allowing the Greeks to embark. However,
a contrary wind is even now driving them back.
Thoas is preparing to hunt the fugitives down when
Athena appears and stops him; he is, moreover, commanded
to send the Greek maidens home. He consents,
and the play ends with the joy of the chorus.</p>

<p>This drama is one of the finest among Euripides’
works. It provides a marked contrast with the
<i>Troades</i>; there is bitterness here indeed, but it is the
bitterness of Voltaire rather than that of Swift. And
whereas in the former play plot is almost non-existent,
here it is vital. Perhaps the most brilliant piece of construction
in Euripides is the celebrated Recognition-scene
of this drama. Indeed the whole tragedy is the
story of a plot, skilful and breathless. Iphigenia’s method—to
deceive by telling the truth (about Orestes’ matricide)—was
particularly dear to Greeks, connoisseurs
of falsehood both in life and in literature; so beautifully
does she succeed that (partly for her own amusement)
she tells the king further the news she has just heard
concerning her brother’s welfare. But the poet is no
more the slave of his wit than of his sympathies, and
we are brought to realization of the facts—namely, that
the three Greeks are thieves and Iphigenia a traitress—by
her own self-mockery: “Falsehood, thy name is
Hellas,”<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> and by the simple generosity with which the
prince accepts her suggestions.</p>

<p>The second feature of importance is the atmosphere
of adventure. A strange grim glamour lies upon this
story of breathless dangers in a region which is itself a
mystery and a menace. We must forget modern notions
about South Russia, lines of steamboats, and Odessa
as civilized as Hull. This kingdom of Thoas is as remote
from Athens as Thibet or the Upper Congo from
us; indeed at many points we recall the African stories
of Sir Rider Haggard. Amid these ghastly altars, the
secret fire and the cleft of death,<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> deserted seas and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
bloodthirsty savages, there is an infinite painful sweetness
in Orestes’ reminder of a dusty heirloom in his
sister’s bedchamber at home.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> The poem is filled with
suggestions of remoteness, the heaving of strange
billows, legendary landing-places. Flowing from this
is the home-sickness which breaks out again and again,
in Pylades’ recollection, during his worst agony, of the
winding Phocian glens,<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> and in the lyric songs where
the Greek captives long to fly homeward with the
halcyon to the hallowed places of Greece.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>But not only does religion as a radiant emotion
setting a glow around “the hill of Cynthus” and the
“circling mere” mark the play. Euripides here, as
so often, treats religion intellectually as well as emotionally.
By the lips of Orestes he passes judgment upon
Olympian religion as a guide of conduct. Taking the
story of Æschylus, he acts not as a lesser unbeliever would
have acted; he does not dub the reconciliation of the
<i>Eumenides</i> a delusion. With a studiously bungling air
he explains that one section of the Furies was appeased,
and the other not.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> If the manner of this revision is
delightfully impudent, the intention is deadly. Orestes
has been sent away by the Delphian priests to <i>do</i> something,
to seek and undergo, if possible, a physiological
effect simply through the excitement of a far journey.
We are very near to the “long holiday and change of
air”. The Furies exist nowhere but in his own brain.
On the Athenian Areopagus he went through a climax
of hallucination. Surrounded by stray animals,<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> he saw
in imagination all the tremendous events imagined by
Æschylus as objective reality. His mind only partly
cleared by this paroxysm, he fled back to Delphi for
complete healing. The “oracle” sent him to the remotest
region known to Greeks, to a land, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
where the natives are wont to murder all strangers.
Phœbus is ashamed of his “former responses” and seeks
to be rid of his too obedient, too persistent devotee.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
Such is the opinion of Orestes himself when at last in
the “toils,”<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> and the whole work (with an exception
presently to be noticed) is pervaded by this unflinching
rationalism. The pious herdsmen who see marine
deities in the Greek visitors are laughed to scorn by a
companion who, though dubbed “a fool reckless and
irreverent,”<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> is entirely justified. Iphigenia’s reflections<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
on the human sacrifices of the Tauri lead her to acquit
the goddess of “such folly” and to attribute this practice
to ferocious savages who make gods in their own
image. At one point indeed simple faith is justified.
Orestes when faced by death is comforted by his friend:
“The god’s oracle hath not yet destroyed thee, close as
thou dost stand to slaughter”.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> In a moment Orestes
is free from peril at the priestess’ hands. But no one,
least of all Euripides, expects even the “gods” to
blunder always. Finally, the ode on Apollo’s conquest
of Delphi is a delicate but pungent satire: the “oracle”
is a magnificent trade connexion.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p>This cynical clearness is a guide in studying the
exceptional passage above mentioned: in the last scene
orthodox piety is upheld by the apparition of Athena.
Does then the <i>Iphigenia</i> in the end refute the rationalism
impressed on it almost everywhere? We can take our
choice, accepting Athena, Apollo’s divinity, and all the
other traditional garnishments, but stultifying many passages,
and the tone of nine-tenths of the play; or we
can accept the latter as a thrilling and pathetic study in
human superstition and intrepidity, but reject Athena as
a conventional phantom. In this latter case we shall,
with Dr. Verrall, consider that the play, for all artistic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
and intelligible purposes, ends at v. 1434, leaving
Thoas to capture and destroy the Greeks. Many will
find such a choice difficult. The <i>Iphigenia</i> is certainly
not as clear a case as the <i>Orestes</i>, to say nothing of the
<i>Ion</i>. But it is difficult to believe that here he has composed
a magnificent play to bolster up theology which
elsewhere he strenuously attacks. Nevertheless, the
speech of Athena is not in itself contradictory or
ludicrous.</p>

<p>The mental pathology—it can hardly be called the
character—of Orestes, deserves close study. He provides
an admirable instance of that skill in portraying
madness for which Euripides was famed.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> A man of
strong simple instincts, he is shaken terribly by the murderous
events of his childhood. His brain is overthrown
by the sway of the hierarchy and by the deeds
to which he was impelled. From this overthrow he
never quite recovered, as the dramatist himself carefully
indicates.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> Throughout the <i>Iphigenia</i> we discern, drawn
with extraordinary skill and tact, the struggle between
the old obsession and an intellect originally clear and
acute. The prologue, when he explores the ground
with Pylades, shows him (in spite of a ghastly brilliance
of thought fit only for frenzy or the nightmare<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>) possessed
of shrewdness which, if consistently applied, would have
saved him from the expedition altogether. Later he is
seen hurled by the excitement of his quest into complete,
though temporary, insanity<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>—a fit which throws back
strange light upon his “trial” at Athens and provides a
comment upon the later scene,<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> where, though at the
moment sane, he yet believes in the delusive experience.
Everywhere we find this superstructure of sanity
on an insane foundation. Though he can see through
the “oracle” as clearly as any man with regard to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
past deceptions, he is pathetically enthusiastic for the
latest nostrum.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The long account<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> of his sorrows
which he gives his sister is full of such sinister meaning.
He essays to describe the origin of the court which tried
him: “There is a holy ... <i>vote</i>,<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> which long ago
Zeus founded for Ares owing to some blood-guiltiness,
whatever it was....” He has forgotten half the facts,
and bungles the rest. This speech, full of obscurity,
irrelevancy, and disconnected thought, is practically
ignored by his sister, who realizes his condition both
from the report of the herdsman and from the occasional
lunacy he manifests in conversation.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Orestes, too,
knows<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> how it is with him, and the complete absence of
lament on his part when faced with death is one of the
grimmest things in the drama.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Electra</span><a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> (Ἠλέκτρα) was probably acted in 413
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> The scene is laid before the cottage of a peasant,
who explains that he is the husband of Electra, but in
name only; she comes forth and they depart to their
several tasks. Orestes and Pylades arrive; Orestes has
come at Apollo’s bidding to avenge his father, at whose
tomb he has offered sacrifice. Seeing Electra they
retire. She is invited to a festival by the chorus
of Argive women, but refuses, urging her sorrow and
poverty. The two strangers approach, Orestes pretending
that he has been sent by her brother for tidings
of her; she gives him a passionate message begging
Orestes to exact vengeance. The peasant returns and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
sends the strangers within as his guests; the chorus sing
the expedition to Troy. An aged shepherd enters with
the provisions for which Electra sent, and tells her that
he has seen upon Agamemnon’s tomb a sacrifice and
a votive lock of hair. He in vain seeks to convince
Electra that her brother must be in Argos, but later
recognizes Orestes by a scar. Brother and sister embrace
with joy; after passionate prayers to Agamemnon’s
shade he departs to seek Ægisthus. The chorus sing
the crime of Thyestes which caused sun and stars to
change their course. A messenger relates how Ægisthus
has been cut down by Orestes in the midst of a
religious service; the avengers return with the body,
over which Electra gloats. Clytæmnestra is seen approaching,
lured by a story that Electra has given birth
to a child. Orestes feels remorse, but is hardened by
his sister, who awaits her mother alone. A dispute
follows about the queen’s past, but Clytæmnestra refuses
to quarrel, and goes within to perform the birth-ritual.
Soon her cries are heard, and Orestes and Electra re-enter,
filled with grief and shame. In the sky appear
Castor and Polydeuces (Pollux), brothers of Clytæmnestra,
who blame the matricide, which they attribute to
Apollo; then they depart to the Sicilian sea to save
mariners who are righteous and unperjured.</p>

<p>Special interest clings to this play, because here only
can we see Euripides traversing precisely the same
ground as Æschylus (in the <i>Choephorœ</i>) and Sophocles
(in the <i>Electra</i>), This similarity of subject long
damaged Euripides’ play in the eyes of critics. It was
assumed that the youngest poet was imitating his forerunners,
and it needed small acumen to observe that
the imitation was bad. Whereupon, instead of wondering
whether perhaps Euripides was after all not copying
others, critics proceeded to write cheerful nonsense
about “frivolity” and “a profound falling off in art and
taste”.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> The fact simply is that each of these three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
tragedians discussed the story from a different viewpoint.
Æschylus treated it as a religious fact, Sophocles as an
emotional fact, Euripides as an ethical fact. Æschylus
is on the side of Apollo, Sophocles on the side of Electra,
Euripides on the side of no one. He asks himself what
circumstances, what perversions of character, can result
in this matricide.</p>

<p>Hence his careful study of Clytæmnestra, Electra,
and Orestes, so careful that a reader at first supposes
the poet a partisan of Clytæmnestra. Not so; he has
merely tried to understand her. A placid woman of
quick but shallow affections, she was abandoned by her
husband for ten years to the memory of a murdered
daughter. Delightfully characteristic is her argument:
“Suppose Menelaus had been stolen from home; would
it have been right for me to slay Orestes that Helen
might regain her husband?”<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Vigorous and damaging,
this is yet tinged with comedy by its raw novelty and
precision. One almost overhears the <i>commèrages</i> of
the street-corner. When Agamemnon brought back
openly a concubine to his home, Clytæmnestra assisted<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
her lover in anticipating the king’s revenge by murdering
him. From this act she has drifted into condoning
cruelty against her unoffending children; throughout
she has acted wickedly and acquiesced in worse conduct
by others. Nevertheless, she is no figure of tragedy; she
only suggests tragedy because she is the mother of her
executioners. Her chief love is placid domesticity; if
this can be obtained only by murdering those who
threaten it, that is very terrible, but the world is notoriously
imperfect. Clytæmnestra cannot, and will not,
meet Electra on the tragic plane. Her daughter’s great
outburst and threat of murderous vengeance she meets
in this comfortable fashion: “My child, it was always
your nature to love your father. It often happens so.
Some favour the male side, while others love their
mother rather than their father. I forgive you: for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
in truth I rejoice not greatly, child, in the acts that I
have done.... But you!—unwashed and shabby in
attire!” ... And so forth. Clytæmnestra is almost
as ill-tuned to the atmosphere which Electra constantly
and deliberately creates as Sancho Panza to the
high converse of his master. The queen has been
summoned to her daughter’s cottage by report of a
newly-born infant. She shows her natural goodness of
heart by hurrying thither at once (though of course she
has not the taste to leave her gorgeous retinue behind)
and doing all she can to comfort and help her daughter.
By this time she has all unconsciously “taken the wind
out of the sails” of the avengers. But Electra can
maintain her grimness and actually utter black hints of
a wedding-bed in the grave!<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> We turn next to her;
what manner of woman can this be?</p>

<p>Electra is one of Euripides’ most vivid and successful
female characters. She has strong claims on our pity
and sympathy, but fails to win them. Her mother is
a ready victim of any emotion which breathes upon her;
Electra has settled her position emotionally, intellectually,
morally, years ago. Nothing can alter her; she
is the victim and the apostle of an <i>idée fixe</i>. The crimes
of love are no less frightful than the crimes of hate;
in Electra affection for Agamemnon has become the
basis of cold ferocity against Clytæmnestra. It is
Orestes who shrinks when the deed is to be done,
Electra who braces his resolution. She has borne no
child. Instead of beginning a new life in her children,
looking to the future, she has fed morbidly upon
memories, stiffening natural grief and resentment into
permanent inhuman morosity. Clytæmnestra has
blandly outlived two murders in her own family, and
remains neither unamiable nor uninteresting; but it is
impossible to imagine what Electra will do, say, or
think, after the events of to-day. This unnatural self-concentration,
which means not only her mother’s death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
but her own spiritual suicide, is mainly the result of her
childlessness. And it is on this that Euripides lays his
finger. “Announce that I have given birth to a male
child.... Then, when she has come, of course it is
her death.”<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> This plot of Electra is possibly the most
brilliantly skilful and most terrible stroke in all the
poet’s work. It indicates the source of her heartlessness,
it provides an excellent dramatic motive for the queen’s
arrival, and it shows, as nothing else could show, the
fiendishness of a woman who can use just this pretext
to the very woman who gave her birth. She relies
upon the sanctity of motherhood to aid her in trampling
upon it. Her first words, as she slips forth to join her
husband beneath the star-lit sky, show how the heavens
themselves remind her that she has had no infant at her
breast during the night-watches: “Black Night, thou
<i>Nurse</i> of golden stars”.<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Moreover, not only does she
feel her sorrows, she enjoys the sense of martyrdom.
Her wrongs and present trials she is capable of exaggerating;<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
at every opportunity she exploits them for
purposes of self-pity, as her husband hints more than
once.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

<p>Orestes, living in exile, has escaped the blight of
Electra only to become a criminal with no illusions,
proud of his worldly experience, witness the blundering
disquisition on “the true gentleman,”<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> and his cynical
comments on his humble brother-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> His onslaught
upon Ægisthus from behind proves him at the best
deficient in gallantry, and on the matricide itself nothing
need be said. We can pity Orestes for his fearful
position, but he is a poor creature. The <i>Electra</i>, in
fact, is a clear-sighted attack upon the morality of blood-feuds.
The poet feels that Ægisthus and Clytæmnestra,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
left so long unmolested, should have been left
alone still; if Apollo at Delphi, and the peasant in his
Argive cottage, had estimated human nature more
wisely, this horror would have been escaped, and no
harm done. To punish the guilty is not always a
virtue; often it is a debauch of self-glory, and sometimes
the worst of villainies.</p>

<p>As always, the poet regards the “oracle,” which commanded
matricide, as an offence to civilization. But
there is novelty in the extreme candour with which this
is put forward. The Dioscuri repeatedly stigmatize
its murderous command as “foolishness” or worse.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
Equally outspoken are the chorus, who devote the last
stanza of their lovely song on the Golden Lamb and
Thyestes’ crime to a brilliant denial of its truth.... “But
legends that fill men with dread are profitable to divine
worship”<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>—it is admirably put, and may rank with the
epigrams of Ovid<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> and Voltaire.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> As for the Dioscuri,
it is impossible to speak without affection of such quaint
and charming figures. Their converse with Electra
and the chorus is an irresistible combination of dignity
and a breezy contempt for official reticence. In his
first long <i>ex cathedra</i> speech Castor is on the verge of
saying what he really thinks of Phœbus Apollo, remembers
himself just in time, and then—gives a broad hint
after all.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> In the less formal talk which follows, these
bluff naval deities show a soundness of heart and a
simplicity as to the meaning of great affairs which recall
delightfully the traditional nautical character of modern
literature. The anguish of brother and sister who
after long years meet for a few frightful hours only to
part for ever awakes their instant deep sympathy.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> On
the other side these subordinate deities are assuredly
in a maze as to the theological problem into which they
have strayed. “How was it,” ask the Argive women,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
very pertinently, “that you, being gods and brothers
of the woman that hath perished, did not repel destruction
from the house?” Electra, too, would know why
she was involved in the matricide. In answer the
Brethren offer a bundle of reasons some one of which
ought surely to be right: “the fate of necessity,” “the
guidance of doom,” “the foolish utterances of Phœbus’
tongue,” “a partnership in act and in destiny,” “the
ancestral curse”.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Even if traditional phrases could
solve the problem of human sin, these simple souls are
not qualified to use or expound them.</p>

<p>One incident in the <i>Electra</i> is of particular interest
to the historian of literature. The pædagogus seeks to
convince Electra that the mysterious visitor to Agamemnon’s
tomb is her brother. He offers certain evidences
which she contemptuously rejects. There can be
no doubt that this scene is a criticism of the Recognition
in Æschylus’ <i>Choephorœ</i>. The severed lock of hair, the
footprint, and the embroidered cloth, appear in both
scenes. Electra rejects all these clues. How can the
hair of an athletic man resemble the soft tresses of a
woman? Is not a man’s foot larger than a woman’s?
Will the full-grown Orestes wear the same garment as
an infant? But Euripides’ attack is probably mistaken.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
We may suppose that Æschylus could have seen these
objections; and it is quite possible that tradition told of
physical peculiarities in the Pelopid family. As for the
embroidered garment, Æschylus does not call it so.
It may well have been a cloth preserved by Orestes.
However this may be, we have here the most distinct
example of Euripides’ criticism of an earlier poet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span><a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> (Ἑλένη), or <i>Helena</i>, was produced in 412 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
The scene represents the palace of Theoclymenus, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
young Egyptian king, with the tomb of his father Proteus.
Helen relates that Hera gave Paris a phantom
in place of the true Helen. While Greeks and Trojans
fought for a wraith, she herself has lived in Egypt, waiting
for Menelaus. Theoclymenus now seeks her hand;
she has taken sanctuary in Proteus’ tomb. Teucer
enters to consult Theonoe, the king’s prophetess-sister.
On seeing Helen he barely refrains from shooting her,
but realizing his “mistake” talks with the stranger, revealing
that Menelaus and “Helen” have apparently
been lost at sea. Helen sends him off and breaks into
lamentation for Menelaus, but is advised by the chorus
of captive Greek maidens to consult the omniscient
Theonoe. She agrees, and they accompany her into
the palace. Menelaus enters, a pitiable shipwrecked
figure. He has left “Helen” and his comrades in
hiding, and is looking for help. When he knocks at the
palace-door the portress repels him with the warning
that the king is hostile to Greeks because Helen is
within his house. Menelaus is thunderstruck, but determines
to await Theoclymenus. The chorus and
Helen return in joy, for Menelaus, they learn, still lives.
Menelaus comes forward; after a moment his wife recognizes
and would embrace him, but he repels the
stranger. One of his companions arrives announcing
that “Helen” has vanished. As he ends his tale he
sees the true Helen, who he supposes has played a
practical joke; but Menelaus falls into her arms. They
plot escape, but realize that all depends upon the omniscient
Theonoe; she comes forth, and, explaining that
she has a casting-vote in a dispute which to-day takes
place in Heaven between Hera and Aphrodite, decides
to aid the suppliants. When she has withdrawn it is
arranged that Menelaus shall pretend he is the sole
survivor, Menelaus being drowned; Helen is to gain
permission to offer funeral-rites at sea. The chorus
raise a beautiful song concerning Helen’s woes and
the Trojan war. Theoclymenus enters and is easily
hoodwinked. After an ode on Demeter’s search for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Persephone, the plotters are sent on their way by the
king. The chorus sing of Helen’s voyage and pray the
Dioscuri to convoy their sister. A messenger hurries
in and tells of the escape; the Egyptian crew has been
massacred by Menelaus’ followers. Theoclymenus
would take vengeance upon his sister, but is checked
by the Dioscuri, who explain that all has occurred by
the will of Zeus.</p>

<p>Two aspects of this play are unmistakable and apparently
incompatible. The plot closely resembles that
of the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i>; the style and manner of
treatment are curiously light. What can have been Euripides’
purpose in repeating, after so short an interval, a
copy of that grim masterpiece, and to execute it in this
light-hearted fashion? The <i>Helen</i> is in no possible
sense a tragedy. At the point where the audience
should be spell-bound by suspense and dread—the
cajoling of the king—we are relieved from all oppression
by the facility with which the captives succeed. Theoclymenus
is an imbecile who gives them all they need
with his eyes shut. The earlier action is robbed of all
power by the superhuman attributes of Theonoe. How
can, or need, Helen have any doubts concerning her
husband with an all-knowing friend at hand? The
central <i>datum</i>, that only a phantom fled to Troy and
returned therefrom with Menelaus, is utterly destructive
of tragic atmosphere. In the Recognition-scene the possibility
of pathos is drowned in absurdity: the messenger
suddenly turns to find his mistress smiling at his elbow
and greets her with relief: “Ah, hail, daughter of Leda,
here you are after all!”<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> Teucer’s scene, besides providing
a palmary instance of bad construction (for his
function is merely to cause Helen anxiety about her
husband’s fate, which one might have expected to arouse
her curiosity earlier in the course of these seventeen
years), is in itself absurd. After coming all this distance
to consult Theonoe about his route, he is sent away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
happy (without seeing the prophetess) by Helen’s suggestion,
“You will pick out your way as you go along”.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>
Equally curious is the diction. Brilliantly idiomatic as
are the iambics, they are almost everywhere light, loose
in texture, almost colloquial. Such things<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> as φέρ’ ἦν
δὲ δὴ νῷν μὴ ἀποδέξηται λόγους;—ἣν γὰρ εἴχομεν
θάλασσ’ ἔχει—εἷς γὰρ ὅ γε κατ’ οὐρανόν, and the silly
jingle on λόγῳ θανεῖν, are typical of the whole atmosphere.
Even the lyrics glow with prettiness rather
than beauty; lovely as are the Naiad<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> and the Nightingale<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
they mitigate in no degree the flimsiness of the
whole.</p>

<p>Theonoe herself, in an outrageous passage,<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> brings
the mockery to a climax: “This very day among the
gods there is to be strife and conference concerning
thee before the throne of Zeus. Hera, who was thine
enemy before, is kindly to thee now, and would bring
thee safe to thy home-country with this thy wife, so
that Greece may learn how Paris’ love, the gift of
Cypris, was but a mockery. But Cypris would fain
deny thee thy home-return, that it may never come
to light how in Helen’s case she bought the prize of
beauty with bridals that were naught. <i>And the
decision lies with me</i>, whether, as Cypris wishes, I shall
destroy thee by revealing thy presence to my brother,
or whether I shall join Hera and save thy life.” We
should be ill-advised to take this in all earnest as
a ludicrous blasphemy. It is graceful trifling. But
what is Theonoe—a dread goddess to whom the queen
of Heaven sues for aid, or a kind-hearted woman whose
strong common-sense might, perhaps, in a circle like
that of the dolts and <i>poseurs</i> who fill the stage, raise
her to the repute of superhuman wisdom? She is
not all playful. When the honour of her dead father
is in question, she stirs the heart by her passionate
solemnity:—</p>

<p class="noindent">This stands, together with Hecuba’s outburst<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> in the
<i>Trojan Women</i>, as the most explicit statement of
personal religion in the extant plays of Euripides. In
the midst of this farrago of fairy-tale and false sentiment,
it is doubly startling. The drama is neither tragedy,
nor melodrama, nor comedy, nor farce. What are we
to think of it?</p>

<p>Dr. Verrall<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> would regard it as a burlesque, that
is, as a playful imitation of serious work, with exaggeration
of weak features or tendencies. From the
facts that one ode<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> has nothing whatever to do with
the plot, but with the Mother and the Maid, and
that Aristophanes parodies the play in his <i>Celebrants
of the Thesmophoria</i>, wherein Euripides is accused of
profaning that festival, it is inferred that <i>Helen</i> was
not written for public presentation, but for private
performance at a house on the island of Helene belonging
to an Athenian lady. The occasion was a
gathering of women who had been celebrating the
Thesmophoria, and forms Euripides’ playful answer
to the charge that he had never depicted a good
woman. To prove his zeal, he chooses Helen (the
least reputable of her sex) and completely rehabilitates
her character.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> At the same time he amuses his
audience with a parody of his own work. The sanctuary
of Helen recalls that of Andromache, and the escape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
that of Iphigenia and her friends. The news of this
<i>tour de force</i> spread, and at last, owing to public
curiosity, it was exhibited at the Dionysia.</p>

<p>There is no doubt (i) that the <i>Helen</i> is not serious
either in intention or execution; (ii) that there is good
evidence for supposing a connexion between the play
and the festival of the Mother and the Maid, the
Thesmophoria; (iii) that Aristophanes’ jokes about
Proteus-Proteas and the rest do support the view
that Euripides has in his mind the history of a family
who have nothing to do with Menelaus and Helen;
(iv) that in the play there are points, such as “Eido”
(the baby-name of Theonoe), which are irrelevant to
the story. Are we, then, to accept Verrall’s account?
The sound view would appear to be that Euripides
offered to the Archon a work which for once was a
burlesque. So sincere a thinker as Euripides was certain
sooner or later to attack himself, at any rate to examine
his position and methods with humorous detachment.
So far we may, we must, go with Verrall; the elaborate
and delightfully detailed development we can hardly
accept—the evidence is not sufficiently strong.</p>

<p>But the poet is making fun not only of himself.
The false Helen and her disappearance at a crisis in
the action, are not merely miracles of a type in which
he utterly disbelieves; they are features which even
a believer would remove as far as possible into the
background. In handling this fairy-tale with such
<i>naïveté</i>, he is possibly laughing at some indiscreet
fellow-dramatist;<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> certainly he is ridiculing the popular
belief in such legends. Helen herself cannot credit
the tale of Leda and the Swan.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> When given the
choice between two accounts of her brothers’ fate,
she prefers the non-miraculous version.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Even the
dramatist’s own dislike of soothsayers is elaborately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
expounded by the Greek messenger and sympathetically
echoed by the chorus,<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> absurdly enough in a play which
contains Theonoe, whom the chorus themselves have
induced Helen to consult, and with success; although
of course Theonoe knows only what could be learned
by listening to the talk of Menelaus.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Phœnissæ</span><a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> (Φοίνισσαι), or <i>Phœnician Women</i>,
was produced about the year 410 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The action takes
place before the palace of Thebes. Jocasta explains
that the blind Œdipus is kept prisoner there by his sons
Eteocles and Polynices, whom he has therefore cursed
with a prayer that they may divide their inheritance with
the sword. They have arranged to rule for a year by
turns; but Eteocles, at the end of his term, has refused to
retire and Polynices has brought an army against Thebes.
Jocasta has arranged that the brothers shall meet. When
she has gone, a pædagogus shows the Argive host to
Antigone from the roof. Next the chorus appear, a
band of Phœnician maidens who sing of their voyage
and of Delphi, their destination. Polynices stealthily
enters and is greeted rapturously by his mother; Eteocles
follows, and the brothers quarrel bitterly and finally.
The chorus sing of Cadmus and the harvest of warriors.
Eteocles comes forth and is advised by Creon to post
a champion at each of the seven gates. He agrees,
ratifies the betrothal of Antigone to Hæmon, and bids
Creon consult Tiresias as to the hope of victory; if
Polynices falls he is not to be buried in Theban ground.
The chorus sing to Ares who has filled the land with
war in place of the delightful Dionysiac worship; they
celebrate the wondrous history of Thebes. Tiresias
enters with Creon’s son Menœceus, and declares that
victory can be won only if the youth is sacrificed.
Creon arranges to send his son away, but Menœceus
resolves to slay himself. The next ode celebrates the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
Sphinx, the tale of Œdipus, and Menœceus’ nobility.
A messenger brings to Jocasta tidings that her sons are
about to engage in single combat; she hurries to the spot
with Antigone. After a brief ode of suspense, Creon returns
mourning for his dead son, and another messenger
tells at length how Polynices, Eteocles, and Jocasta have
died. Thebes has won complete victory. The corpses
are brought in, followed by Antigone, who summons
the aged Œdipus. Together they bewail the dead till
Creon breaks in and decrees that Antigone must marry
Hæmon, Œdipus go into exile, and Polynices remain
unburied. Antigone defies him: she will bury her
brother, she will not marry Hæmon, but will share her
father’s exile. Œdipus as they depart asserts his greatness
as the Conqueror of the Sphinx.</p>

<p>This work was immensely popular in antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> It
was repeatedly “revived”; ancient authors quote from
it often; together with the <i>Hecuba</i> and the <i>Orestes</i> it
formed the final selection of Euripides’ work made in
Byzantine times; and the scholia are extremely copious.
Because of its popularity, the play was considerably
expanded by interpolation. It is no mere question of
isolated lines inserted by actors or copyists, though such
appear to be numerous; considerable masses are due to
a later poet or poets.</p>

<p>The following passages<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> are generally suspected:</p>

<p>(i) vv. 88-201, the scene of Antigone and her
attendant upon the roof-terrace. To this it has been
objected<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> that the entrance of Polynices should occur as
the first event of the play after the closing words of the
prologue which mention his expected arrival. This
passage contains, moreover, a number of words otherwise
unknown which is enormous considering the length of
the scene, and several awkward or strained expressions.</p>

<p>(ii) vv. 1104-40, the description of the seven chieftains
as they advance upon the gates. It is “full of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
obscurities and difficulties,”<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> particularly two elaborate
yet frivolous descriptions of shields. Moreover, it practically
repeats the terrace-scene; both passages can
hardly be genuine.</p>

<p>(iii) 1223-58 (or 1282), the messenger’s account of
preparations for the single combat, followed by the
dialogue in which Jocasta calls Antigone to accompany
her to the field. Not only are there marked faults of
style;<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> it is impossible, considering the urgency<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> of
the news, that the queen should stay for this tedious
narrative. Jocasta’s conversation with Antigone is by
no means so objectionable. It is very short, and the
style is not unworthy<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> of Euripides. Nevertheless, it is
strange that the queen should wait for her daughter at
so urgent a time.</p>

<p>(iv) the end of the drama, though at what point
the addition begins is not agreed. The last address of
Œdipus which opens thus<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">unmistakably recalls part of the finale in <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>:<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If we accept the customary date of Sophocles’ play
(405 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), it was produced after Euripides’ death.
Further, the whole scene of Œdipus, Antigone, and
Creon has evidently been expanded and distorted.
According to one version, that followed by Sophocles
in the <i>Antigone</i>, the maiden remained in Thebes after
the battle and buried Polynices; according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
<i>Œdipus Coloneus</i> she accompanied her father into exile.
Here the two versions are combined. Moreover, from
the entrance of Œdipus onwards the play abounds once
more in unnatural or unusual turns of speech. And it
may be thought a serious mistake to bring the aged
sufferer forth at all,<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> thus creating a new interest at the
last moment of a play crowded with incident. But
though this portion contains much unauthentic work, it
appears to be intermingled with the genuine.</p>

<p>Certain other passages are open to suspicion, especially
Jocasta’s prologue and the remainder—hitherto
unmentioned—of the first messenger’s speech.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> We appear
to have Euripides’ prologue, padded out by another
hand. The same kind of recurrent weakness and flatness
marks the messenger’s speech. Above all, when
the speaker seeks to rise to the occasion, his efforts result
in this:<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> “From the scaling-ladder his limbs were hurled
asunder like sling-stones—his hair to Heaven, his blood
to earth; his arms and legs whirled round like Ixion’s
wheel”. This imbecile bombast is fortunately without
parallel in Attic tragedy.</p>

<p>It seems likely that Euripides’ work was in quite early
times (probably the fourth century) expanded by another
poet, whose main contribution was a large addition to
the messengers’ speeches at a date when Æschylus was
little enough known to allow such things as the description
of the hostile champions a good degree of novelty.
The new text was in its turn enlarged by accretions due
to actors.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>Euripides’ own work is vigorous and interesting,<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> a
stirring scene of warfare, patriotism, and strong passions,
which, in its present expanded form, reminds one by
its spirit and its popularity of Kyd’s <i>Spanish Tragedy</i>,
the first favourite of Elizabethan audiences.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> The two
brothers are well distinguished, Polynices by his pathetic
sense that intolerable wrong is urging him against his
will into crime, Eteocles by a dark fervour of ambition
which has grown upon his soul like religion; and their
terrible altercation in the sweeping trochaic metre is equal
to anything of the kind in Euripides for terse idiomatic
vigour. Jocasta’s passionate joy when she sees her
exiled son,<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> joy which stirs her aged feet to trip in a
dance of fond rapture,<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> provides the one light-hearted
moment. And her noble speech of reconciliation<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> is the
single great achievement of the drama.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Orestes</span><a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> (Ὀρέστης) was produced in 408 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
and again in 341.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> It was extremely popular, and formed
with the <i>Phœnissæ</i> and the <i>Hecuba</i> the final selection
of Euripides’ work made in Byzantine times; but the
later interpolations are probably few. The scene is laid
before the palace at Argos. Orestes and Electra, having
slain Clytæmnestra and Ægisthus, are imprisoned in
their own house by the Argive state, which will to-day
decide whether they are to be stoned to death. Orestes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
has been tormented by madness and is now seen asleep,
watched by Electra; she hopes that they may yet be
saved by Menelaus, who has come home with Helen.
The latter enters and requests Electra to go for her to
Clytæmnestra’s tomb with drink-offerings; she is persuaded
to send her daughter Hermione instead. The
chorus of Argive ladies now enter, and their voices
awaken Orestes. Then follows a wonderful scene of
affectionate tendance and a sudden paroxysm of the
sufferer; the chorus sing of the Furies and the agony
through which the house is passing. Menelaus enters
and Orestes passionately implores his aid. Tyndareus
(father of Helen and Clytæmnestra) arrives and denounces
the cowering Orestes: why did he not invoke
the law against his mother? The youth’s long
speech of exculpation further incenses Tyndareus.
When he has departed, Orestes again appeals to Menelaus,
who points out that the only hope lies in the
Argive Assembly. Orestes watches him go with contempt,
but is cheered by the arrival of Pylades, who
throws in his lot with his friend, and the two walk off
to the Assembly. The chorus sing the story of the
house and lament the matricide. A messenger brings
to Electra an account of the debate, which ended with
permission to the criminals to die by their own hand.
Electra pours forth a lyric of painful beauty until the
two youths return. Pylades declares that he too will
die, but suggests vengeance on Menelaus: let them slay
Helen. Electra proposes that Hermione be held as a
hostage whereby Menelaus may be induced to save them.
The two men go within to despatch Helen, whose
shrieks are soon heard. Meanwhile Electra receives
Hermione, who is dragged within. A Phrygian slave
flings himself in terror from a hole high up in the house-front;
in a strange lyric narrative, he tells how amid the
confusion Helen has vanished. Orestes rushes forth in
pursuit, but he is now insane and the slave contrives to
escape. Orestes goes back, and in a moment the house
is on fire. Menelaus rushes in distraught, and sees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
Orestes on the battlements with his sword at Hermione’s
throat. A frantic altercation arises, until Menelaus cries
to the citizens for a rescue. Apollo appears and bids
the quarrel cease. Helen is to become a sea-goddess;
Electra shall marry Pylades, and Hermione Orestes,
who is to stand his trial at Athens; Apollo will reconcile
him to the Argive state.</p>

<p>To appreciate this masterpiece, we must realize that
Euripides, who so often insists on considering tradition
in the light of his own day, has here insisted on that
principle even more definitely than elsewhere. Certain
legendary data are, to be sure, retained. Troy has fallen
but a few years ago; Iphigenia was offered by her father
as a sacrifice at Aulis. Otherwise the events described
might have occurred in the fifth century. Agamemnon,
though a noble of great eminence, was not a king<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>;
Argos is ruled by an Assembly not distinguishable from
the Athenian Ecclesia. The youth who exacts vengeance
with his own hand is told in language which
might have been employed by Pericles, that the vendetta
is an outrage upon law and society; punishment for
crime rests with the State alone.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> The behest of Apollo,
all-important in the <i>Choephorœ</i>, is not even mentioned
in the discussion which decides the fate of Orestes.
The oracle is indeed treated with scant courtesy even by
those most concerned to uphold it; Electra complains
of the god’s “wickedness,”<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> and her brother “blames
Loxias” for urging him to a villainous deed and then
giving no aid.<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> The atmosphere is one in which the
slaughter of Clytæmnestra must be regarded with horror
and the traditional defence of Orestes as unthinkable.
This is not a theological study, but a dramatic essay in
criminal psychology.</p>

<p>In Orestes the playwright has given us one of his
most terrible portraits. Highly sensitive, weak-minded,
over-educated in a bad school, he is unbalanced by the
horror of his father’s death and by the oracular command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
which has blasted his life. In the magnificent
sick-bed scene he, like his sister, fills us with nothing
but pity. But the calmer he becomes the more are we
filled with loathing for this pedant of eighteen, with his
syllogisms justifying murder, his parade of rhetoric,
his hopeless inability to grasp a situation. Rich as is
the world’s drama in villains, Orestes occupies a place
conspicuous. He has little heart and no sense. Both
failings are common. But that both heart and brain
should be replaced by a factitious perverse cleverness,
an incredibly superficial passion for scoring logical points
against opponents who have in hand urgent interests of
real life—this grips us irresistibly. He is an example
of the wreck produced by a highly specialized mental
training which has ignored character. His first address
to Menelaus strikes the note:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Freely will I divulge my woes to thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But <i>as the first-fruits of my plight</i>, I touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy knees, a suppliant, <i>tying prayer</i> the while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To thy <i>unleafèd lips</i>....<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This affected and obscure exordium is followed by
verbal subtleties at every opportunity: “through my
sorrows I live not, yet see the light”<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>—“my deeds, not
my appearance, ravage me”<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>—“my body’s gone, my
name alone remains”.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> But all this is nothing to the
detestable exhibition wherewith he answers the aged
Tyndareus. To the vital point—that Clytæmnestra
should have been brought before a legal tribunal—he
makes no reply whatever. His only difficulties are that
Tyndareus is wounded to the soul by his daughter’s
death, and that he is far older than Orestes. What is
to be done? Simply to “contract out of” natural feelings
so that the way may be clear for pure logic:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">True, matricide doth taint me, yet again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pure am I, for my sire I did avenge.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore let thy great age be set aside</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">From this our conference, for it puts me out;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let me on—’tis but thy hair I dread.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There follows a frigid “statement”—“balance two
against two”<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>—of his father’s claim and his mother’s
offences, and of his own glorious achievement in purifying
social life. The original sinner is Tyndareus
himself who begot so vile a daughter! He ends by an
appeal to Apollo’s behest, and a pompous comment on
the importance of marriage.</p>

<p>The aged Spartan having given his grandson over
to justice as irreclaimable, the youth turns to Menelaus,
whom he insists on regarding as his real hope, in spite
of Menelaus’ plain reluctance and extreme unpopularity
in Argos. He is, moreover, unwilling to endure
another display: “Let me be; I am reflecting....”<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
At all times he is impatient of subtleties; in the first
moments of their meeting he asks his accomplished
nephew: “What mean you? Wisdom is shown not
by obscurity, but by plain speech.”<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> But now that
Orestes has his chance, he refuses to suffer Menelaus’
“reflections,” and with a warning that “a long address
is better than a short one, and easier for the auditor to
follow”<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> produces a masterpiece of metallic cleverness
which presses Seneca himself very hard; perhaps
the finest gem is the offer of Hermione as a kind of
discount.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Before the Assembly he succeeds in combining
several insanely tactless insults to the Argives:
they are “possessors,” not original citizens, of the land;
they were Pelasgians at first, but later “Danaidæ,” descendants
of the women who slew their husbands; and
he has killed his mother as much for their sake as his
father’s.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> But Euripides’ most frightful satire on “advanced
education” is reserved for the nightmare of the
close, where the raving Orestes leans down over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
battlement to the grief-maddened Menelaus and begins
by a lunatic reminiscence of the “Socratic method”:
“will you be the questioner or the respondent?”<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>Prig as he is, Orestes has nevertheless some elements
of nobility at the first. He can tell his uncle plainly
that his disease is “conscience, which convicts me for
a criminal”;<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> he shows real regard for Electra; the
splendidly selfless friendship between him and Pylades
stirs every one. As the play advances, however, we are
lost in the loathing and breathless wonder wherewith we
gaze upon the increasing insanity of the wretched prince.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
Each moment he becomes more vigorous and more lost
to sense of right; when Electra suggests the vilest part
of the plot—the seizure of Hermione—he breaks forth
into a cry like Macbeth’s: “Bring forth men-children
only!”<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>Electra has been the chief definite cause of Orestes’
fall. Amazingly vivid, she fills the whole drama with
a thin acrid fume of malice. Her ruling passion is not
mere hatred against Clytæmnestra. That bitterness
has spread until (saving her tenderness for Orestes)
there is nothing in her but a narrow viperishness.
When an innocent like Hermione draws near, the fang
strikes by instinct. Her intensity of feeling and her
years have made her Orestes’ monitor long before he
returned home, and it is she to whom Tyndareus points,
in searing language, as the more guilty.<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Another
influence has soured her, that lack of husband and
children on which Helen, with the brutality so frequent
in shallow natures, insists at their first meeting.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> But
Electra has vastly more common-sense than her brother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
or Pylades, and it is to her that the delightful comment
on Helen is given:<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, Nature!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saw ye how tiny was that tress she cut,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sparing her beauty? ’Tis the old Helen still!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But her sense of humour cannot sustain her heart
long:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven’s hatred seize thee! Thou hast wrought the fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of me, and this my brother, and of Greece.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These two women, so pungently contrasted in one
brief scene, share, however, one attribute—that nerveless
theology which Euripides detested as rotting the moral
fibre. Electra muses upon “suffering and disaster sent
by Heaven”.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> Helen attributes her elopement with
Paris to the “maddening doom of Heaven,”<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> which has
also “destroyed this hapless pair”<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>—her nephew and
niece. The latter in her lyric outcry explores<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> all the
legends of her line to discover the cause of the present
disaster, a method which the chorus, for all their sympathy,
indeed complicity,<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> seem to parody by the
ludicrous baldness of their reflection that this horror of
fiends and bloodshed has fallen upon the house “because
Myrtilus fell out of the chariot”!<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>All the minor characters are skilfully drawn—Pylades,
the warm-hearted scatter-brained ruffian who
conceives the murder of Helen as soon<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> as he learns
that she is in his friend’s house; Tyndareus, the hot-tempered,
affectionate old king; Menelaus, the vulgar
and successful, who has no other ambition than to let
bygones be bygones<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> and who has actually expected to
find Orestes and Clytæmnestra sharing the same home,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
quite comfortable after the death of Agamemnon;<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>
Helen, that faded, facile creature, who cannot abstain
from conversation, even with murderesses if there is no
one else. Hermione, minute as is her part, commands
our affection, not only because of the vile complot which
centres round her, but for the shy graciousness of the
little she does say, ἥκω λαβοῦσα πρευμένειαν<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> and the
rest; she seems to have strayed from some sunlit lost
drama by Sophocles.</p>

<p>The religious sanction which for Sophocles had
been the background of Orestes’ story and which for
Æschylus provided the most vital part of the action,
has in Euripides’ hands become, as it were, a small,
rather shabby stage-property hung upon the back-scene.
Those Avenging Spirits who hunt the matricide are
now called “frenzies”<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> by his sister, and in the
anxiously precise account<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> which Menelaus elicits from
his nephew, it becomes plain that the three “maidens
like night” are an hallucination; any unfettered
intercourse between them and ordinary men is
out of the question. Traditional belief itself tells
rather against their divinity than for it.<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> Another
stage property is the incidental miracle. Menelaus
at Malea was addressed by the “prophet of Nereus,
Glaucus, truthful god,” who told him of his brother’s
death.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> When we learn that at Nauplia he heard of
Clytæmnestra’s death but from “some mariner,”<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> we
surmise that “Glaucus” too was human.<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> The second
miracle is that related<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> by the Phrygian slave; Helen
vanished, “either by spells or the tricks of wizards or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
stolen by Heaven”. Helen has only hidden herself; the
Phrygian is crazed by excitement and terror. But the
miracle of Helen is vouched for by a more august
witness, Apollo, who asserts that he has saved her from
Orestes’ sword. Thus we arrive at the final triumph of
orthodox religion, the epilogue in which the Delphian god
stays at a word the vengeance of Argos and the quarrel
between Menelaus and Orestes. In the reality of this
epilogue we shall believe according as we find it credible
that Euripides could destroy all the effect of his own
play. All the action, all the atmosphere, which the
dramatist has created, are rent by an utter breach. The
objection is not so much that Apollo and his speeches
are in themselves absurd, though the consolation offered
to Menelaus, that Helen throughout their married life
has given him endless trouble,<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> is (however true) distasteful.
What jars hopelessly is the monstrous discontinuity
of event and emotion. As elsewhere, this
orthodox Olympian and his epilogue are a sham,
devised to suit the demands of an audience which
“knew” how Orestes went forth from Argos to Athens.
The real drama ends with the wild breakdown of
Menelaus, and for the three criminals and their victim
the doom falls which sin and bitter madness have made
inevitable.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>But the Orestes is not remarkable as a study in
scepticism, like the <i>Ion</i>. Even the psychology, superb
as it is, cannot be regarded as the cause of the immense
popularity which the play won in antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> It is pre-eminent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
for magnificent situations. The sick-bed scene
is unforgettable, especially that marvellous hushed song<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
of Electra beside her sleeping brother:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Holy night, outpouring ever</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Slumber’s boon on souls that mourn,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Where, ’neath woes that leave it never</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Lies a princely house forlorn.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The whole progress of the later scenes is splendidly
exciting, and in the midst Euripides has set the audacious
scene of the Phrygian slave who replaces the conventional
messenger’s speech with his wild lyrical narrative,
incoherent and baffling. Equally brilliant is the finale
in which actual lunacy confronts the delirium of despair
and grief, with the frail victim flung upon the parapet,
the knife brandished in the madman’s grasp, and the
flames which are to end the horror already rising behind.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Bacchæ</span><a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> (Βάκχαι), or <i>Bacchantes</i> (female
votaries of the god Bacchus or Dionysus), was produced
in 405 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, soon after the poet’s death in Macedonia,
and with its companion-plays obtained the first prize.</p>

<p>Dionysus, standing before the palace of Thebes, tells
how, disguised as a prophet, he has brought his religion
into Greece. His purpose in Thebes is to punish the
sisters of his mother Semele for declaring that their
sister had united herself not with Zeus but with some
mortal, and to crush the young king Pentheus, who
opposes his worship. Already the Theban women are
revelling upon Mount Cithæron, filled with the Bacchic
ecstasy. He departs to join them, and the chorus of
Phrygian votaresses throng in uttering a rapturous
eulogy of their religion. Tiresias and Cadmus are next
seen preparing to join the revels, when Pentheus enters
and reproaches them. Their answers enrage him
further and he orders the arrest of the stranger-prophet.
The chorus appeal to Holiness against the oppressor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
reciting the blessings of Dionysus and the doom of
pride; they yearn to revel unchecked. The Stranger is
brought in; Pentheus questions and insults him, finally
haling him away to the stables. The chorus sing their
indignation and desire for the aid of Dionysus in person
when the prophet is heard summoning fire and earthquake;
the women in frenzy greet the overthrow of
the palace. Their leader comes forth and relates how
Pentheus in vain sought to bind him and how the god
has thrown the house into utter ruin. Pentheus rushes
out in fury, but is met by a rustic who relates the
revels and miracles performed by the Theban votaresses.
This excites the king still further, but the Stranger dissuades
him from the use of armed force; let him go
disguised as a woman to witness the revels. Pentheus
retires into the palace with the prophet, who reveals
the king’s coming doom to the chorus; they rejoice in
their future freedom and the fate of the ungodly. Pentheus
re-appears, dressed as a female reveller and utterly
under the Stranger’s influence. The two depart for
the mountains, the king being now practically imbecile.
The chorus fiercely call for bloody vengeance, then
praise the humble endeavour after all that is beautiful
in life. A messenger returns with the story of Pentheus’
death: he has been torn to pieces by his mother
Agave and her companions. Agave enters in mad
triumph with her son’s head, followed by Cadmus, who
bears the mangled remains of his grandson and gradually
brings Agave back to her senses. He laments<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> the
prince who was the comfort of his old age.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> Dionysus
appears in the sky, foretells the future of Cadmus and his
wife, and explains that the present sorrows are due to
the will of Zeus. Agave turns away, repudiating the
new religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>Intoxicatingly beautiful, coldly sordid, at one moment
baffling the brain, at the next thrilling us with the mystic
charm of wood and hillside, this drama stands unique
among Euripides’ works. Its wonderful effect flows
from three sources: primitive dramaturgy, lyrical beauty,
the enigma of its theological import. As for the first
of these, there is a marked simplicity both of plot and
characters. A god brings a strange worship into the
land of his birth; the king rejects and scorns him;
whereupon the god turns his people to madness so
that they avenge him upon the king. It is the simplest
possible dramatic concept. If we consider the personages,
comparing Agave with Phædra or Medea,
Pentheus with Ion or Hippolytus, we find an equal
simplicity. The characters of the <i>Bacchæ</i> impress us
less by their subtle truth to nature than by the situation
in which they stand. In this sense the <i>Bacchæ</i> is the
most Æschylean work of Euripides. Like his predecessor
when he composed the <i>Choephorœ</i>, he is studying
directly a great religious fact, which submerges the refinements
of individual psychology, leaving somewhat
stark figures, the God, the Old Man, the King, the
Prophet, and the Woman.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> In technique we are not
far from that primitive stage of modern drama which
exhibits the interplay of Avarice, Lovingkindness, and
the rest. This imparts an even greater attractiveness to
the amazing literary excellence of the whole. This excellence
is of two distinct kinds. The episodes are not
filled with romantic beauty—only a few splendid passages
in the long narratives of messengers exhibit this; they
show the same mastery of a brilliant half-prosaic idiom
which is familiar elsewhere. But the lyrics are the
poet’s finest achievement in this field. Nothing that he
had created hitherto can be compared with them, save
the praises of Attica in the <i>Medea</i><a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> and the song of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
escape in the <i>Hippolytus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> The profound beauty of
their musings on the life of serene piety, the startling
vividness wherewith they express the secluded loveliness
which haunts bare peaks or remote woodlands, the
superb torrent of glowing song<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> which celebrates the
religious ecstasy of Dionysiac votaries, where the
glorious diction is swept along by a tempest of ever
more tumultuous rhythm—all these contribute to make
the <i>Bacchæ</i> something precious and alone.</p>

<p>It is with regard to the third feature, the theological
purport, that disagreement begins among critics. Is the
playwright commending the Bacchic religion to his
fellow-countrymen or is he not? If not, why this
magnificent and intense proclamation of the glory conferred
by belief? But if he supports it, why this dreary
aching scene at the end, when Dionysus hears no voice
raised in loyalty, only the despairing accents of the
woman who repudiates his worship? It may be objected
that perhaps we should not hope for definite
interpretation, that since “like a live thing it seems
to move and show new faces every time that, with
imagination fully working, one reads the play,”<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> perhaps
there is no core of central fact to find. Here lurks a
dangerous confusion of thought. Every work of art
springs from a definite concept held by the artist, some
piece of reality clearly understood and sincerely felt,
insisting on expression at his hands precisely because it
affects him emotionally. The elusiveness of the final
expression is not in the least degree any proof that no
definite doctrine, or experience, or passionate wish, was
its origin; a fern has a physical centre of gravity as
truly as an apple, though more difficult to locate. Rather,
the luxuriant freedom is the proof that there is deep
down something definite, else the freedom would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
anarchy. We conclude that however enigmatic is the
<i>Bacchæ</i>, yet Euripides had a definite opinion about the
two questions: Does the god Dionysus exist? Is his
religion a blessing to humanity? His opinion could
have been written down in a few lucid sentences. Had
this not been so, he would have postponed beginning
his play until it was. This clear concept may itself
indicate “doubt” (if we insist on the word) or rather a
bifurcation of truth, as may be observed in the dramaturgy
of Sophocles.</p>

<p>There is, then, a secret to be discovered. Is it lost
for ever, or not? It appears to some<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> that the drama
contains evidence, unmistakable but long overlooked,
which conveys Euripides’ opinion concerning Dionysus.
The chief, the only certain, clue is contained in the
“Palace-Miracle”. The facts are, that the chorus cry
aloud at the tottering of the building; that Dionysus a
moment later when relating what has happened within,
adds, “And this further evil hath Bacchus wrought
upon him: he hath flung his dwelling to the ground,
where it lies all in ruin”;<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> that, finally, the palace is as
a fact uninjured. This latter point is proved by the
complete silence of all the personages, except Dionysus
and the chorus. Neither Cadmus nor Agave, nor the
two messengers, at their several entrances make the
least remark about it. Above all, Pentheus, who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
within the house when the overthrow is alleged to have
occurred, says nothing about it. Later the prince and
his enemy enter the palace before proceeding to
Cithæron, again with no hint that the building has been
destroyed. It follows that the statements made by the
chorus and by Dionysus are untrue.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> The women
believe what their leader cries out from within and what
he tells them later. That is, they accept what their
own eyes tell them is false. Only one power can work
this marvel of belief—hypnotism, or, as earlier ages
would call it, magic. The Dionysus of this play is
precisely what Pentheus calls him, a “foreign wizard,”<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>
no god at all, but a human hierophant of the new religion.
Brought up in Western Asia, he combines a
profound feeling for natural religion with an un-Greek
leaning to orgiastic ecstasy and an instinct for fiendish
cruelty; so that in spreading the gospel of joy and simple
surrender to the mystic loveliness of Nature he crushes
those who reject him, not destroying them in passion, but
working their misery with a horrible cold relish: he is
Shakespeare’s Richard the Third with religious instead
of political ambitions. As for the Dionysiac religion
itself, the poet feels its vast emotional appeal—feels it so
strongly that he has drawn the most wonderful picture
of ecstatic religion to be found in literature; but if it is
proposed to him as “a way of life” for civilized men he
condemns it as firmly as unwillingly. To give free rein
to passions and instincts hitherto unconscious or starved,
this is a path, perhaps the only path, towards strangely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
beautiful experience, the thrill of communion with non-human
life; but it is not the path for man. Here
Euripides stands at one with the great European
tradition. If man is to attain the height of his destiny
he will seek not the gold of joy but the silver of happiness,
not the blazing rapture of absorption in strange
beauty, but the calm glow of self-understanding and
self-expression. He will not seek to destroy the instinct
for ecstasy, but will harness it, and work it into the
fabric of a sound coherent life. He may be a spectator,
it is true, if not of all time, yet of all existence; his eyes
will shrink from nothing, but his heart is not to be reft
from him. He must prove all things, but hold fast only
that which is good—a moral being, not the slave
of sound and colour. In this drama, where Euripides
seems to voice like some pagan archangel the glory of
a non-moral absorption in the torrent of raw life, he is
fundamentally as moral as at any moment in life. As
Tannhäuser after his sojourn in the Venusberg is at length
won back by the urgency of his own soul into the
Roman Church, so does Euripides unflinchingly present,
to an audience still breathing hard after the glories of
Cithæron, Agave and Cadmus bowed over Pentheus’
mangled body, and the rejection of a god whose unmitigated
demands imply the wreckage of sound human
life.</p>

<p>What, then, are we to believe of Dionysus? If we
refuse him we are liable like Pentheus to be destroyed;
if we surrender ourselves, what of Agave? Here is
a dilemma which Euripides himself did not foresee.
By θεός (“god”) he often means something widely
different from the concept of an ordinary Athenian,
but he never intends all the associations of our word
“God”. For us belief in “God” implies that the
universe holds a personal Governor, all-powerful and
all-wise, who stands to us in a relation emotional as
well as metaphysical. To accept Him is to believe that
His purpose embraces the existence and history of the
universe and of the humblest creature therein, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
because of that belief to merit His love by loving service
of our own. These thoughts are to us tremendous
commonplaces; they would have bewildered any fifth-century
Greek save Æschylus.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> θεός means a power,
usually but not necessarily personal, which is outside
ourselves and affects our life in a manner which cannot
be affected by any wish or act of ours, save possibly
to a small degree by ritual submission. Dionysus, like
the other “gods,” is a permanent fact of life personified.
We must give him respect, take account of him in
our conduct and judgment of others. To ignore him
is not so much sin as utter blindness. If we insist on
the personality of Dionysus we find him attractive but
deadly, a deity who employs his might to entangle
the threads of life, crushing hearts better than his own.
In so far as he is a person he is unthinkable. But as
a fact of life, with no more purpose or will than the
force of gravitation, he is neither good nor bad, simply
a profound reality, one of the elements we must consider
in building our lives. Cadmus expresses this
lesson: “If anyone despises the supernatural powers,
let him look on the death of this man and believe in
the gods”.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>Then why does the poet dwell on the personal
existence of Dionysus? Even if we refuse to believe
the theory outlined already, that this person is a human
hierophant, we can still answer the question. Euripides
is concerned not merely to tell us the truth about
ethics, but to discuss the current theology of his day.
The majority of his fellows believed in a personal Zeus,
a personal Athena and Dionysus. He wishes to convince
them of the falsity, the pernicious falsity, of such
a creed. Take this play in its superficial meaning
and you find a person who is detestable—a god who
does wrong, and who is, therefore, no god at all.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
with him; purify your theology. And when this is
done, we find, not that the drama has fallen to pieces,
but that now it is coherent and forcible. There is in
the human soul an instinct for ecstasy, for a relinquishment
of self in order to feel and bathe in the non-human
glory of Nature. Trample this instinct
ruthlessly down as did Pentheus, and your life is
maimed and shrivelled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iphigenia at Aulis</span><a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> (Ἰφιγένεια ἡ ἐν Αὐλίδι) was
produced soon after the poet’s death in 406 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> by
his son, together with <i>Alcmæon at Corinth</i> and the
<i>Bacchæ</i>.</p>

<p>The scene shows Agamemnon’s tent at Aulis, where
the Greeks are encamped ready to sail for Troy, but
delayed by contrary winds. Before they can set out
Agamemnon’s daughter Iphigenia must be sacrificed
to Artemis. The king has written to his wife bidding
her send the maiden—to marry Achilles. We now
see him in agony beneath the night-sky and entrusting
to an aged slave a letter revoking the first. The chorus
(women of Colchis) enter and describe the pastimes of
various heroes. Menelaus intercepts the letter and
reproaches his brother with treachery. After a vigorous
dispute they learn that Clytæmnestra and Iphigenia
are approaching. Menelaus relents, but they realize
that the sacrifice must proceed. The chorus sing
Aphrodite’s power and the judgment of Paris. Agamemnon
greets his family with half-concealed distress,
and in vain attempts to send his wife back forthwith.
A choric ode describes the impending doom of Troy.
Achilles, seeking Agamemnon, meets Clytæmnestra,
who to his amazement greets him as a son-in-law.
In the midst of their embarrassment the old slave
comes forward and reveals Agamemnon’s purpose.
The queen in agony appeals to Achilles, who promises
to defend Iphigenia. The chorus sing the bridals of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
Peleus and Thetis, Achilles’ parents. Then mother
and daughter piteously beg Agamemnon to relent; he
is heart-broken but determined. Iphigenia utters a
lyric lament, after which Achilles tells how the army
maltreated him for championing Iphigenia. He and
the queen are excitedly debating, when Iphigenia proclaims
her readiness to die for the cause of Greece,
and departs, singing her farewell to life. A messenger
brings a description of the sacrifice: at the last moment
the princess miraculously disappeared, and a hind
was substituted for her by the goddess. Agamemnon
returns and takes leave of Clytæmnestra.</p>

<p>The text of this drama presents curious features.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
There are two prologues, and the last fifty or sixty
lines of the whole are corrupt. It seems that Euripides
died before the work was finished; the gaps were
filled by his son Euripides who produced the trilogy
(<i>Iphigenia</i>, <i>Alcmæon</i>, <i>Bacchæ</i>) soon after 406 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
The original prologue, of the ordinary narrative kind,
delivered by Agamemnon in iambic metre, is embedded
in the later prologue, which takes the form of a dialogue
in anapæsts between the king and his aged retainer.
This later work is extremely charming, filled with the
quiet beauty of night overhanging the feverish ambition
and misery of men. But though the younger Euripides
probably wrote an ending also, this has been displaced
by extremely bad<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> work of a much later time. It is
not easy to understand why such inferior matter was
allowed to eject the composition of the younger Euripides.
Perhaps the explanation is that the concluding
lines were known from the first not to be by the master,
that the play was often produced, and that for these
two reasons rival endings were very early before the
public. They would destroy one another’s prestige,
so that in later centuries none survived, and some
scribe filled up the gap as best he could.</p>

<p>A noteworthy contrast exists between the <i>Iphigenia</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
and the <i>Bacchæ</i>, though they were no doubt composed
at almost the same time. In this play the chorus has
practically no concern with the action, whereas the Asiatic
women form the soul of the <i>Bacchæ</i>. Instead of the
wild loveliness or serene spirituality which thrill us in the
lyrics of that drama, we find here nothing more profound
than graceful complications of phrase and facile
emotion. In compensation, while the <i>Bacchæ</i> is primitive
in psychology, its companion is superior to many
Greek tragedies in the masterly freedom and subtlety of
its character-drawing.</p>

<p>The play is a study of five ordinary characters
under the stress of an extraordinary crisis. This common-place
quality of the personages conveys the whole
purport, giving it a momentous position even among
such works as we have been discussing. In this latest
tragedy no sincere reader can fail to detect himself under
the thin disguise of names. Many men were pointed
at as the original of Meredith’s Sir Willoughby Patterne,
and for the same good reason most Athenian husbands
must have stirred a little on their benches in the presence
of this unheroic Agamemnon. There is nothing heroic
in any of the persons. Menelaus is an ordinary man—artlessly
selfish at one moment, artlessly and uselessly
kind-hearted at another, and a master of fluent invective
which reveals his own failings. Clytæmnestra is an
ordinary woman, showing indeed a queenly dignity in
the normal relations of life, but when puzzled or alarmed
revealing herself a thorough <i>bourgeoise</i>, and when confronted
by the doom which threatens her daughter forgetting
all her pride, clutching at even the most pitiful
means<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> of gaining a respite, and utterly broken when
her hope dies away. Agamemnon is an ordinary
man, thrown by circumstances into a position where
both generalship and statesmanship are needed, attempting
to rule his army by diplomacy and his family by
military discipline, with ruin as the result. Fatally open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
to suggestion, he makes and remakes subterfuges, seeking
to spare every one’s feelings until at last he drifts into
the necessity of slaying his own child. Even Iphigenia
is an ordinary girl. It is precisely because she is a common
type that we grieve for her anguish and triumph
in her exaltation. Macaria in the <i>Heracleidæ</i> is almost
unknown save to professed students of Euripides. She
knows no fear or hesitation and lives on the heights; we
recognize in ourselves no kinship with her. But Iphigenia
we meet every day. She is no heroine, but a child.
Her delight at seeing her father again shows all a child’s
amiable abandon; her pitiful cries and shrinking at the
prospect of death are those of the ordinary happiness-loving
girl. When finally the agony of her father, the
empty clamour of Achilles, her mother’s undignified tremors,
nerve her to trample her own dread under foot, we
rejoice precisely because what we witness is the triumph
of common human nature. Even Achilles, son of a
goddess as story reported him, is a common-place person
too. This is not the hero who flames through the <i>Iliad</i>,
but a young noble led into the extreme of folly by this
very legend that his origin is divine. Perhaps nothing
even in the deadly Euripides is quite so fatal to the
traditional halo than the incredible speech<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> wherewith
Achilles comforts Clytæmnestra. Of vast length, full of
spurious, jerky rhetoric and contradictory comments on
the situation—which, however frightful, appeals to him
mostly as an atmosphere in which he can pose—this
oration reveals him as a sham. Fortunately for him, he
is never undeceived. This man is not the Achilles of
tradition; he is spiritual brother of the mad prince in
the <i>Orestes</i> and the ancestor of Mr. Shaw’s Sergius
Saranoff.</p>

<p>In his last work, then, Euripides, so far from showing
any exhaustion of power, appears on the verge of
new developments.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> He has drawn still nearer to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
new comedy of Menander. The suddenness with which,
after the quarrel between Agamemnon and Menelaus,
the crisis is precipitated by the entrance of the messenger
announcing Iphigenia’s arrival—the man breaks into the
middle of a line<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>—is a remarkable novelty. The altercation
itself shows a brilliant freedom of idiom which
even this poet has hardly reached hitherto. There is
at least one unprecedented license of metre.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> And the
complete change of spirit which comes upon Iphigenia
was novel enough to offend Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cyclops</span><a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
    (Κύκλωψ) is the only complete<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> satyric
play now extant. No indications of date<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> seem available.</p>

<p>The background is a cave on Mount Etna, wherein
dwells the Cyclops, or one-eyed giant, Polyphemus.
Silenus tells how he and the satyrs have become the
ogre’s slaves. He is sweeping out the cavern when the
chorus of satyrs drive in their flocks. Odysseus and his
men arrive, seeking provisions, which Silenus eagerly
sells for a skin of wine. The conversation is interrupted
by Polyphemus who decides to devour the intruders.
Odysseus eloquently appeals to him, but receives a
brutal and blasphemous reply. The giant drives the
Greeks within, and the chorus express their disgust at
his cannibalism. Odysseus tells how two of his men
have been eaten; he himself has gained favour by the
gift of wine, and proposes that they all escape, after
blinding Polyphemus with a red-hot stake. The chorus
joyfully assent. Polyphemus comes forth drunk and
intending to visit his brethren, but Odysseus dissuades
him. The Cyclops asks Odysseus his name and is told
“Noman”; he promises to eat his benefactor last. The
revel proceeds until Polyphemus retires, whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
Odysseus calls for action, but the chorus all offer ridiculous
excuses. The hero goes within to perform the task
with his comrades. Soon the giant reappears, blind
and bellowing with pain, while the satyrs joke about
“Noman,” and give him false directions so that the
Greeks escape from the cave. Odysseus reveals himself,
and Polyphemus recognizes the fulfilment of an
oracle. He threatens to wreck the ship, but the others
depart unconcernedly to the beach.</p>

<p>This brief play—it has hardly more than seven
hundred lines—is invaluable as being the only complete
work of the satyric type which we now possess. Considered
in itself, it is of small value,<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> though it must have
formed an agreeable light entertainment. The lyrics are
short and trifling. Of characterization there is little,
and that little traditional and obvious—Odysseus is
pious, valiant, resourceful; Polyphemus brutally sensual,
the satyrs cowardly and frivolous. Though there are
passages of tension, the audience can never have felt
any marked excitement, as the whole story, except that
the satyrs are imported by the dramatist, is taken from
a well-known episode in Homer<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>; even such things as
the joke on the name Outis<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> (“Noman”) and the comparison<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
between the spit which blinds Polyphemus and
the auger of a shipwright, are borrowed from the epic.
The nature of satyric drama in general is discussed
elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Here it will be enough to note that there
are “tragic” features in this play; Odysseus throughout
speaks and acts in a manner as dignified, perhaps more
dignified, than in certain tragedies of our poet. The
farcical scenes provided by the rascally Silenus, the
obscene jests and cowardice of the chorus, and a
certain approximation<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> to comedy in the iambic metre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
used by them or by Polyphemus, are marks of a satyric
play. It should be noted, however, that even without
them, the <i>Cyclops</i> would be no tragedy. Polyphemus
is no tragic antagonist of the hero. His exposition of
his philosophy of life,<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> such as it is, must not persuade
us that there is here any valid moral antagonism as
foundation of the drama. Odysseus contends with him
and eludes him as one might escape the violence of a
ravening animal.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rhesus</span><a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> (Ῥῆσος) is a drama of uncertain date
and authorship. The action is founded on the Tenth
Book of the <i>Iliad</i>, and takes place at night in the
Trojan camp. Hector has defeated the Greeks and
hopes to destroy them at dawn. The drama opens with
a song by the chorus of sentinels, come to warn Hector
that the Greeks are astir. He is ordering instant attack
when Æneas urges that a spy be first sent. Dolon
volunteers, and sets forth disguised as a wolf, followed
by the admiration and prayers of the chorus. A herdsman
announces the approach of the Thracian prince,
Rhesus, with an army to aid Troy, but Hector is displeased
with his tardiness, and, despite the joyful ode
of the chorus, greets his ally with reproaches. Rhesus
offers excuses, promising to destroy the Greeks without
Trojan help, and to invade Greece; Hector takes him
away to bivouac. The chorus depart to rouse the
Lycians, whose watch comes next. Odysseus and
Diomedes steal in, intending to slay Hector. They
have met Dolon and learned from him the position of
Hector’s tent and the watchword, “Phœbus”. Athena
appears, bidding them slay Rhesus and take his wondrous
steeds. They depart, and, seeing Paris draw near, she
calms his suspicions under the guise of his protectress
Aphrodite. Next she recalls the Greeks, who have slain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Rhesus. An exciting scene follows, in which the chorus
seize Odysseus, who escapes by using the pass-word.
The chorus sing the daring of Odysseus. A wounded
charioteer of Rhesus staggers in, proclaiming his
master’s death, of which he accuses Hector, who sends
him away for tendance. As the chorus lament, a Muse
appears in the sky, bearing the body of her son Rhesus.
She sings a dirge and curses Odysseus and Diomedes.
Next she tells of her union with the river-god, father of
Rhesus, and upbraids Athena. Hector promises glorious
obsequies, but she declares that her son shall live on
in the Thracian mountains as a spirit half-divine.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>
Hector orders an assault upon the Greeks, and the
chorus sing a few courageous words.</p>

<p>This admirable drama stands quite by itself. There
is a minimum of psychology; the lyrics are mostly of
slight value. But the writer has not aimed at a tragedy
of the usual type. Its excellence lies in the vigour
and excitement of the action. Almost all the scenes,
especially the debate at the opening, and the escape of
the Greeks, are written by a master of vivid realism,
who is less concerned with character-drawing. The
unwearied Hector, the cautious Æneas, the vaunting,
splendid, barbarian prince, the fiercely loyal charioteer—these
are all obvious types. The only really fine stroke
of psychological insight occurs where Hector, himself
reckless at first, is by the absurd presumptuousness of
Rhesus forced into discretion.<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> What really stirs one
is the thrilling atmosphere of danger and the magical
little lyric<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> which falls half-carelessly from the wearied
sentries when the night begins to wane:—</p>

<p>Some ancient critics denied that Euripides wrote
the <i>Rhesus</i>, and the great majority of modern scholars
have accepted this view.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> The evidence for Euripidean
authorship is as follows: (i) The play comes down to us
in the manuscripts of that poet. (ii) That Euripides
wrote a <i>Rhesus</i> is known from the <i>Didascaliæ</i> or
Dramatic Records. (iii) Early Alexandrian writers
quote passages from our text as from “the <i>Rhesus</i> of
Euripides”. On the other side are (i) a statement in
the <i>Argument</i>:<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> “Some have suspected this drama to
be spurious, and not the work of Euripides, for it reveals
rather the Sophoclean manner”; (ii) various features
of the work which modern critics have regarded as
suggesting an inferior playwright: (<i>a</i>) the plot is superficial;
(<i>b</i>) there is no prologue;<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> (<i>c</i>) four actors are
needed; (<i>d</i>) Æneas and Paris have practically nothing
to do; (<i>e</i>) the chorus is employed in a manner foreign
to Euripidean plays; (<i>f</i>) there is a lack of force and
pathos; (<i>g</i>) there is no rhetoric; (<i>h</i>) there is no sententiousness;
(<i>i</i>) we have here the beginning of historical
drama, which is later than the fifth century; (<i>j</i>) the
style is eclectic: imitations of Æschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides are to be observed.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>Several of these objections are plainly unfounded.
Four actors are not clearly necessary, as was shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
above. Pathos, of a kind quite Euripidean, is to be
found in the scene where the Muse laments her glorious
son. And how deny rhetorical force to a poet who can
write such brilliantly vigorous things as:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Aye, friends in plenty shall I find, now Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stands firm for us, and Fortune guides my sword.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I need them not! Where hid they those long years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Troy, a galleon with her canvas rent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reeled onward through war’s shrieking hurricane?<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The high-hearted defence<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> of Rhesus is full of the same
tingling rhetoric. Yet many critics<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> of the highest rank
have denied Euripidean authorship to the <i>Rhesus</i>. On
the other side stands<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> the testimony of the almost contemporary
record. One consideration, obvious yet too
often ignored, may help us. The earliest work of
Euripides to which we can assign a date—the <i>Alcestis</i>—belongs
to the year 438. The poet was then at least
forty-two years old. Is it beyond belief that twenty
years before the <i>Alcestis</i> the youthful dramatist composed
a stirring tale of war and hair-breadth escape,
which owed much to the manner of Æschylus, especially
in his handling of the chorus? During the period
for which we have evidence, he was constantly testing
the possibilities of his art. Need we assume that until
the <i>Alcestis</i> he had not advanced?</p>

<p>The soundest view appears to be that we have here
a very early work of Euripides. This is confirmed by
the critic Crates, an Academic philosopher of the second
century before Christ, who asserted that Euripides was
still young when he wrote the <i>Rhesus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> To this should
be added whatever help may be drawn from contemporary
history. It is natural to suppose that when
this drama was composed Athenian politics were closely
concerned with Thrace. An Athenian colony at Nine
Ways, afterwards called Amphipolis, was destroyed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
the Thracians in 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> In 436 the place was resettled
under the new name by Hagnon, who brought
the bones of Rhesus from the Troad back to Thrace.
The later year, as connected with the hero, would seem
the more suitable, were it not for the words<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> of his
mother who refuses burial for her son and proclaims
his strange life after death: “hidden in caverns of the
silver-yielding soil he shall lie as a human spirit, still
living”. Such language would rather be avoided after
the bones themselves had been visibly committed to
Thracian earth. On the whole, one thinks the situation
more suitable to some period, anterior to Hagnon’s expedition,
when Thracian politics were in the air, perhaps
quite soon after the disaster of 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p class="tb">Of the lost plays we have about eleven hundred fragments.
Few of these comprise more than three or four
lines, but a fair conception of several dramas can be
formed from reports of the plot, parodies by Aristophanes,
and the remains themselves.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Telephus</span> was acted in 438 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, together with
<i>The Cretan Women</i>, <i>Alcmæon at Psophis</i>, and <i>Alcestis</i>.
Sophocles won the first prize, Euripides the second.
Telephus, King of Mysia, was wounded by Achilles when
the Greeks invaded Mysia in mistake for Troy. His
wound would not heal, and he entered his enemies’
country disguised as a beggar, to consult the Delphic
oracle, which declared that “the wounder would heal
him”. Meanwhile the Greek heroes were deliberating
at Argos about a second expedition. Agamemnon
refused to set forth again, and uttered to Menelaus the
celebrated words: Σπάρτην ἔλαχες· ταύτην κόσμει—“Sparta
is thy place: make thereof the best”. While
the council was in progress Telephus begged audience.
His disguise was penetrated by Odysseus, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
about to be slain when he snatched up the infant Orestes,
threatening to kill the child if the Greeks molested him.
He was given a hearing and justified his action in fighting
the Greeks when they invaded his country. His
hearers were won over, but it was found that Achilles
had no knowledge of medicine. Odysseus suggested
that the real “wounder” was Achilles’ spear. Telephus
was thus healed, and in his gratitude consented to guide
the Greeks to Troy.</p>

<p>We possess in the <i>Acharnians</i> of Aristophanes an
elaborate and brilliant parody of the interview granted
to Telephus. Dicæopolis, an Athenian farmer who
has made peace on his own account with Sparta, is
attacked by his fellow-citizens, the charcoal-burners of
Acharnæ, and only obtains leave to plead his cause by
threatening to slay their darling—a coal-basket. Then
he begs from Euripides the beggar’s outfit of Telephus,
and, returning, delivers a clever harangue denouncing
the war. The baby-hostage idea Aristophanes used
again in the <i>Thesmophoriazusæ</i>, where Mnesilochus, in
great danger from the infuriated women, seizes the
infant which one of them is carrying, only to find it a
concealed wine-skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philoctetes</span> was produced in 431 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> with the
<i>Medea</i>, <i>Dictys</i>, and <i>Harvesters</i> (Θερισταί), when both
Euripides and Sophocles were defeated by Euphorion,
the son of Æschylus. Our knowledge is derived almost
wholly from Dio Chrysostom<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> who compares the three
plays called <i>Philoctetes</i> by Æschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides. He offers interesting comments on the differences
in plot. In Euripides, as in Æschylus, the
chorus consists of Lemnian men, but the later poet
anticipates criticism by making his chorus apologize for
not visiting the sufferer earlier. One Lemnian, by name
Actor, takes part as a friend of Philoctetes. The “prologue”
is spoken by Odysseus (here working with Diomedes,
not Neoptolemus, as in Sophocles) who explains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
that he would not have undertaken this present task for
fear of being recognized by Philoctetes, had not Athena
changed his appearance. (Here, as in the apology
offered by the chorus, we have implied criticism<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> on
Æschylus.) The Trojans are sending an embassy in
the hope of gaining Philoctetes. Later in the drama,
no doubt, occurred a set dispute between the Greek and
the Trojan envoys.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Bellerophon</span> Euripides seems to have gone to
the extreme in depicting the passionate atheism inspired
by the sight of prosperous wickedness. “If the gods
do aught base,” he exclaims in a famous line, “they
are not gods.” Another vigorous fragment begins:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then dare men say that there are gods in Heaven?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, nay! There are not. Fling the tale away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ancient lie by human folly bred!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Base not your judgment on these words of mine—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Use but your eyes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bellerophon ascended to Heaven on his winged steed
Pegasus in order to remonstrate with Zeus. This idea
is used farcically in Aristophanes’ <i>Peace</i>, where Trygæus
ascends on a monstrous beetle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erechtheus</span> was a beautiful picture of patriotism.
Athens being attacked by the Eleusinians and Thracians,
King Erechtheus was told by the Delphic oracle that
he could secure victory for Athens by sacrificing his
daughter. His wife Praxithea, in a speech of passionate
patriotism, consented to give up her child; Swinburne
has used this fragment in his own <i>Erechtheus</i>. Another
long fragment contains the advice which Erechtheus
gives to his son, and which in its dry precision
curiously resembles the farewell of Polonius to Laertes.
While the issue of battle remains uncertain, the chorus
of old Athenians sing a lyric which charmingly renders
their yearning for peace:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Along my spear, at last laid by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">May spiders weave their shining thread;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May peace and music, ere I die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With garlands crown my whitening head.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I’d deck Athene’s cloistered fane</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With shields of Thracian mountaineers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ope the well-loved page again</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where poets sing across the years.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another popular play was the <span class="smcap">Antiope</span>. It dealt
with the persecution of Antiope by Lycus, King of
Thebes, and his wife Dirce. She was rescued from
death by her two sons, Amphion and Zethus, whom she
had been compelled to abandon at birth, and who discovered
the relationship in the critical hour. The chief
interest of the play was the contrast between the brothers—Zethus
a man of muscle, devoted to farming; Amphion,
a musician and lover of the arts. Euripides developed
this contrast in a long debate wherein culture
was upheld against the “Philistine”. We still read
one criticism of myth which recalls a blunt passage of
the <i>Ion</i>.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Story said that Antiope’s sons were the offspring
of Zeus, but Amphion has the hardihood to express
doubt to his mother herself.</p>

<p>With the <i>Helen</i> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 412) was produced a work of
the first importance—the <span class="smcap">Andromeda</span>, a charming love-story
full of romance and poetical loveliness. It was
immensely popular; Aristophanes gives in his <i>Thesmophoriazusæ</i>
a parody as elaborate as that of <i>Telephus</i> in
the <i>Acharnians</i>, and it was a perusal of this drama which
excited Dionysus in the <i>Frogs</i> to descend to Hades
for the purpose of fetching back the dead playwright.
Lucian<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> tells how Archelaus, the tragic actor, came to
Abdera and performed the <i>Andromeda</i>. The whole
town grew crazy over it. “They used to sing the solo
from the <i>Andromeda</i> and recite Perseus’ speech from beginning
to end. The town swarmed with these actors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
of a week’s standing, pale and lean, shouting with all the
strength of their lungs</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Love, of gods and men tyrannic Lord,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and all the rest of it. This went on for a long time, in fact
till winter, when a severe frost cured them of their nonsense.”
The <i>Andromeda</i> points forward to the novel, and
it is interesting to note that in the best Greek novel—the
<i>Æthiopica</i> of Heliodorus, who wrote about eight hundred
years after Euripides’ death—the heroine’s father, like
Andromeda’s, was an Æthiopian king.</p>

<p>Scanty as are the remnants of this drama, we can
still form some idea of its structure.<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> “It is the crowning
virtue of all great art that, however little is left of it by
the injuries of time, that little will be lovely.”<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> The
country of Cepheus, the Ethiope king, was ravaged by
a sea-monster, and the only help lay in sacrificing to the
creature Andromeda, the king’s daughter, who was bound
to a rock and left as his prey. At this point the action
begins. It is still night and from the cliff rises the
lament of the captive:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">O solemn night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">How slow thy coursers trace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the holy Heaven star-bedight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their pathway through the deeps of space!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At each pause in her song comes the voice of Echo repeating
the sad syllables, till Andromeda is joined by the
maidens who form the chorus. The lyric dialogue concluded,
it seems<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> that the father and mother, Cepheus
and Cassiopeia, enter and that there is some talk of
attacking the monster; Phineus, brother of the king and
the affianced of Andromeda, shrinks from the risk. But
now comes unlooked-for aid. Perseus, fresh from his
slaughter of the Gorgon, arrives, borne through the air<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
on his winged sandals. Though Zeus is his father, in
this play he figures as the lowly hero familiar in our own
fairy-tales. Certainly he appears to be contrasted with
the rich but cowardly Phineus, and the helpless despairing
king. His first words have been preserved:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Gods! To what alien kingdom am I come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On sandals swift, between the earth and Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Journeying homewards on these wingèd feet?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But soft! what crag is that by tossing foam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Surrounded? Lo, the statue of a maid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hewn from the living rock by patient art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its craftsman’s master-work!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Drawing near, he perceives that this thing of beauty is
a living maiden, and at once longs to make her his bride.
When she asks his name, instead of proudly claiming
Zeus as his father, he mentions his own name, his
journey’s end, and his achievement:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Περσεύς, πρὸς Ἄργος ναυστολῶν, τὸ Γοργόνος</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">κάρα κομίζων.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But he is no mediæval knight; he does not forbear to
state his claim before addressing himself to the task:
“And if I save thee, maid, wilt give me thanks?”
Andromeda, on her side, feels and speaks without
subtlety:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Stranger, have pity on my sore distress:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Free me from bonds,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and again</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Take me, O stranger, for thy handmaiden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or wife, or slave.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Before encountering the monster Perseus comes to an
understanding with Cepheus and goes forth to the conflict,
calling upon Eros to aid his chosen:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Love, of gods and men tyrannic Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Either teach Beauty to unlearn her power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or speed true lovers, through th’ adventurous maze</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in thy name they enter, to success.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shall all men to thee pay reverence.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Refuse, and lo! thy glories fade to naught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en through thy very boon of wakened hearts.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Two or three lines picture the grateful crowd of rustics
who surrounded the victor: “all the shepherd-folk flowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
around him, one bringing an ivy-bowl of milk for his
refreshing, another the joyous grape-juice”. Phineus
sought to assert his claim upon Andromeda, but was repulsed
by her father. Later the maiden’s parents themselves
begged her not to leave them desolate. In a
thrilling<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> reply she declared that she would cleave to her
husband. Then follows mention of a wedding-feast,
and at the close it seems probable that Athena foretold
the future.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Phaethon</span> we are fortunate in possessing two
unusually long fragments of seventy and seventy-five
lines respectively. It is an exciting and romantic story—the
legend of Phaethon, child of the Sun-god, who
called upon his father to prove their relationship by permitting
him for one day to drive the chariot of the Sun.
This conception, gorgeous with the spirit of adventure
and an un-Greek yearning for what transcends mortal
power, seems to have filled the whole play with glow
and rushing movement. A fragment of the prologue

<p class="noindent">From Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> to whom we owe this extract, we learn
that the palace of Merops is close to the abode of the
Sun-god. This notion that the youth’s home is only
an hour’s walk from the palace of the Sun, gives a sense
of delightful verisimilitude.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> It appears that Phaethon
in this prologue tells how his father Merops plans to
marry him to a goddess, but that he himself is unwilling.<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
Clymene, his mother, to persuade her son that he will not
be distastefully united to one vastly his superior, reveals
that he is the son not of Merops but of the Sun-god,
Helios, who promised her long ago that he would grant
her child one wish. Let Phaethon approach Helios with
some request, and prove her story. The prince resolves
to do so. The chorus of female attendants enter with
a lovely song in honour of Phaethon’s wedding; they
picture the whole earth awakening to daily activities.
Next appears the king, who describes the brilliant future
which awaits his son.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Phaethon views with distaste
this life of easeful splendour; to him at this moment may
well be attributed the vigorous words<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Goethe has indicated, with splendid insight, the dramatic
power which must have filled this scene: the aged king
offering the easy joys of riches and a royal home to this
youth already burning in secret for the high enterprise
of seeking his real and divine father.</p>

<p>Later the interview was described between Phaethon
and Helios, who after seeking to dissuade him, granted
his request and added anxious instructions:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let not thy steeds invade the Afric sky:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its temper hath no moistness, and thy wheels</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Downward must sink....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Direct thy path toward the Pleiads Seven.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impatient of the rest, he snatched the reins</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And smote the wingèd coursers till they flew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unchecked thro’ opening vistas of the heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His father, mounted on a blazing star,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rode after, warning him: “Drive thither, boy!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wheel yonder!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The messenger seems to have continued with a
picture of Phaethon’s fall. The body, still giving off the
smoke of destruction, is next brought in, and we possess
part of Clymene’s frantic speech. Her grief is mingled
with terror: the strange manner of her son’s death may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
provoke her husband Merops to inquiry and reflexion
and so her long-past union with the Sun-god may come
to light. She bids them hide the body in the treasure-chamber,
of which she alone holds the keys. Soon the
king enters amid lyric strains celebrating the marriage-day
of Phaethon. He is giving orders for merry-making
when a servant hurries out to inform him that the
treasure-chamber is giving forth clouds of smoke.
Merops hastens within, and the chorus bewail the disclosure
which is imminent. In a moment the stricken
father is heard returning with lamentation. The course
of the last scene is not certain, but probably a god reconciled
the king and his wife, giving directions for the
disposal of Phaethon’s body; a beautiful but obscure
fragment,<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> redolent with the charm of breezes and murmuring
boughs after all this blaze and splendour, seems
to point to the story of Phaethon’s sisters, who mourned
him beside the western waters and were transformed
into poplars. This god was probably Oceanus,<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> the
father of Clymene. He alone (deity of the world-encircling
water) could give unity to these two pictures,
the radiant eastern land of Phaethon’s youthful enterprise,
and the distant western river where his sorrows
and his end are bathed in dim beauty.</p>

<p>This sketch allows us to realize how much we have
lost in the <i>Phaethon</i>. The romantic events and setting
recall the <i>Andromeda</i>. Clymene’s sorrow and shame
mingle strangely with the gallant enterprise and bright
charm of the whole, somewhat as Creusa’s story is contrasted
with the fresh cheerfulness of Ion. Above all,
the noble simplicity and high-hearted adventurousness
of Phaethon, inspired by his new-found kinship with a
god and chafing at the placid programme of domestic
honour and luxury which his supposed father sets before
him—this is a concept of boundless promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hypsipyle</span>,<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>
    which was produced late<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> in Euripides’
life, is specially interesting through the discovery
in 1906 of extensive fragments at Oxyrhynchus in
Egypt. Previously it was known by scanty quotations of
no great interest, though apparently much prized in
ancient times.<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> The plot is now in the main clear.
Hypsipyle, grand-daughter of the god Dionysus and
daughter of Thoas, King of Lemnos, was exiled because
she refused to join in the massacre of the Lemnian men
by their women. Previously she had borne twin sons to
Jason. These she lost when expelled from her home.
She is now slave to Eurydice, Queen of Nemea in the
north of the Peloponnese, and nurse to her infant son
Opheltes. Her own sons come in quest of her, and without
recognizing their mother are entertained in the palace.
Hypsipyle is quieting the child with a song and a rattle
when the chorus of Nemean women enter. Next
certain soldiers arrive from the host which the seven
chieftains are leading against Thebes. Their commander,
the prince Amphiaraus, explains that the army
is in need of water, and Hypsipyle consents to show
them a spring. Later she returns in anguish: during her
absence the child has been killed by a great serpent.
Eurydice is about to slay her, when she appeals to
Amphiaraus, who pleads her cause and promises Eurydice
that the Greeks shall found a festival in honour of
the child. (This festival is that of the famous Nemean
Games.) He sees that this fatal accident is a bad omen
for the enterprise of the Seven, and names the child
Archemorus<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> instead of Opheltes. Eurydice is appeased.
Later we find Hypsipyle and her sons made
known to one another, and the god Dionysus appears,
apparently to arrange future events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>Though there is one difficulty as to the plot, namely,
that we do not know what function was assigned to
Hypsipyle’s sons—they cannot have been introduced
merely for the recognition-scene—the whole conception
strikes one as simple and masterly. It has been well
remarked<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> that while a modern dramatist would have
omitted the Theban expedition, “nothing seemed to the
Greeks worthy of contemplation in the theatre by a
great people, unless it had some connexion with the exploits
and the history of nations.... On the same canvas
the death of one little child and the doom of the seven
chieftains with their crowding battalions are depicted in
a perspective which sets the former fatality in the foreground.”</p>

<p>The captive princess, even through the ruins of the
text, shines forth with great charm. Her whole life
centres round her lost children and the brief magical
time of her union with Jason. The chorus reproach
her with her indifference to the exciting presence of
Adrastus’ great army—she will think of nothing save
Argo and the Fleece. When at point to die her spirit
flashes back to those old days in a few words of amazing
poignancy:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ὦ πρῷρα καὶ λευκαῖνον ἐξ ἅλμης ὕδωρ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ἀργοῦς, ἰὼ παῖδ’....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ah, prow of Argo and the brine that flashed into
whiteness! ah, my two sons!” Her talk with them
towards the end is a pathetic and lovely passage equal
to anything Euripides ever wrote in this kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Melanippe the Wise</span><a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> appears to have been a drama
of unusual personal interest. Æolus espoused Hippe,
whose daughter Melanippe became by Poseidon mother
of twin sons. The god bade her hide them from
Æolus, and they were discovered by grooms in the care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
of a bull and a cow. They, supposing the children
miraculous offspring of these animals, reported their discovery
to Æolus, who decided to expiate the portent by
burning the infants alive. Melanippe was instructed to
shroud them for death. In order to save her children
without revealing her own secret she denied the possibility
of such portentous births, but seems to have found
herself forced at length to confess in order to prove the
natural origin of the infants. Æolus condemned her to
be blinded and imprisoned, her offspring to be exposed.
Her mother Hippe appeared as <i>dea ex machina</i><a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> and
saved her kin.</p>

<p>The great feature of this play was the heroine’s
speech in which she sought to convince her father that
such a portent was impossible. Lines from the opening
of this argument are preserved: “The story is not mine—from
my mother have I learned how Heaven and earth
were once mingled in substance; when they separated
into twain they engendered and brought into the light
of day all creatures, the trees, birds, beasts, nurslings of
the sea, and the race of men”. The speech was an
elaborate scientific sermon to disprove the possibility of
miracles. Similarly, according to a famous story, the
drama opened originally with the line: “Zeus, whoever
Zeus may be, for only by stories do I know of
him ...”; but this open agnosticism gave such offence
that Euripides produced the play again with the words:
“Zeus, as Truth relates....” A different but closely-connected
source of interest is the fact that here
Euripides veiled his own personality less thinly than
usual. That Melanippe was only his mouthpiece appears
to have been a recognized fact. Dionysius of Halicarnassus<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>
observes that it presents a double character,
that of the poet, and that of Melanippe; and Lucian<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>
selects the remark on Zeus in the prologue as a case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
where the poet is speaking his own views. The
“mother” from whom “Melanippe” learned her philosophy
has been identified with the great metaphysician
and scientist Anaxagoras, who was banished from
Athens in 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; and it is natural to suppose that
this <i>Melanippe</i> is not much later than that year, perhaps
much earlier<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> in view of the strongly didactic manner.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
Hartung refers to this play the splendid fragment:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ὄλβιος ὅστις τῆς ἱστορίας</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἔσχε μάθησιν, μήτε πολιτῶν</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">πράξεις ὁρμῶν,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀλλ’ ἀθανάτου καθορῶν φύσεως</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">κόσμον ἀγήρω, πῇ τε συνέστη</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">ἔργων μελέτημα προσίζει.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Happy is he who hath won deep learning. He setteth
himself neither to hurt his fellow-citizens nor towards
works of iniquity, but fixeth his gaze upon the ageless
order of immortal Nature, the laws and methods of its
creation. Unto such a man never doth there cling the
plotting of base deeds.” If these lines point at Anaxagoras
and belong to our play, the two significant clauses
which defend the moral character of the philosopher in
question indicate the year 430 itself.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cresphontes</span> had immense success as a powerful
melodrama. Polyphontes, having slain his brother
Cresphontes, King of Messenia, seized his throne and
married his widow Merope, who sent her infant son
Cresphontes away to safe keeping in Ætolia. When
he grew up he returned to avenge his father. At this
point the action begins. Cresphontes seems to have
delivered the prologue; since Polyphontes fearing his
return has offered a reward to whoever shall slay him,
he has determined to win the usurper’s confidence by
claiming to have destroyed his enemy. Meanwhile,
Merope, alarmed by the proclamation of the king, has
sent an aged slave to find whether Cresphontes is well;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
he returns with tidings that the prince has disappeared
from Ætolia. Merope gives her son over for lost, and
observing the youthful stranger who is received with
joy by the king, she becomes convinced that he is the
murderer of her son. While he lies asleep she steals
upon him with an axe, when the old slave recognizes
the stranger and stops her arm. Mother and son are
united, and at once plot to slay Polyphontes. Merope
pretends to be reconciled to the king, who in his joy goes
to sacrifice, accompanied by the youth, who takes advantage
of a suitable moment to slay his enemy.</p>

<p>Plutarch, nearly six centuries later, testifies<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> to the
sensation which the Recognition caused in the audience.
Merope herself seems to have been a figure ranking with
Hecuba in the <i>Troades</i>. The tidings of her son’s death
draw from her words which in their quiet dignity of
grief have something of Wordsworth:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Children have died ere now, not mine alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wives been widow’d. Yea, this cup of life</div>

    <div class="verse indent18">... Insistent Fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Taking in fee the lives of all I lov’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath made me wise.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Probably it was Merope again who uttered the
famous lines which advise lament over the newly-born
and a glad procession to accompany the dead. The
recognition-scene is singled out for especial praise by
Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>The fragments of this tragedy include a perfect jewel
of lyric poetry, a prayer to Peace:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">A paraphrase might run thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>O Peace, thou givest plenty as from a deep spring: there is no beauty
like unto thine, no, not even among the blessed gods.</p>

<p>My heart yearneth within me, for thou tarriest; I grow old and thou
returnest not.</p>

<p>Shall weariness overcome mine eyes before they see thy bloom and
thy comeliness? When the lovely songs of the dancers are heard again,
and the thronging feet of them that wear garlands, shall grey hairs and
sorrow have destroyed me utterly?</p>

<p>Return, thou Holy One, to our city: abide not far from us, thou that
quenchest wrath.</p>

<p>Strife and bitterness shall depart, if thou art with us: madness and
the edge of the sword shall flee away from our doors.</p>

</div>

<p>Matthew Arnold’s <i>Merope</i> has the same plot and
includes a recognition-scene which probably resembles
the lost original closely. His conception of Polyphontes
is thoroughly Euripidean.</p>

<p>Of the other lost plays little can be said here. Still
amid this faint glow of star-dust many marvellous things
are to be discerned—words of tremulous tenderness
from the <i>Danae</i> describing the charm of infancy; a line
from <i>Ino</i> which in its powerful grimness recalls Æschylus,
“like a lone beast, he lurks in caves unlit”;<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> out of the
<i>Polyidus</i> the celebrated query,</p>

<p>But the student must at his leisure explore the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
marvels of these rock-pools left by the retiring ocean.
One majestic passage<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> from the <i>Cretans</i> shall suffice to
close this survey. The lines are from a march sung by
the Curetes or priests of the Cretan Zeus, and show that
even in the Hellenic world the monastic spirit was not
unknown:—</p>

<p>It now remains for us to attempt a synthesis—to set
before ourselves as clearly as may be the whole personality
of Euripides. We are studying not the programme
of a politician, but the spirit and method of a great artist,
the inspiration of a great teacher. An artist has other
things to heed than a superficial consistency of presentation;
and a teacher of permanent value shows his followers
not what to think, but how to think—not opinions,
but the reasoned basis of opinion. Euripides is a man
not of dogmas, nor indeed of negations; he is the apostle
of a spirit which blows whither it lists, setting up a
healthful circulation of tingling life throughout regions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
which have languished in the heavy air of convention.
His work forces us to think and feel for ourselves, not
necessarily to think and feel with him.</p>

<p>The briefest description of his special quality is that
he is in the same moment a great artist and a great
rationalist—a man profoundly conscious of the beauty
and value of all life, all existence, all energy, and yet an
uncompromising critic of the vesture which man throws
around those parts of the Universe which are subjected
to him. No man has ever loved and expressed beauty
with a mind less swayed by illusion. These two instincts,
the instinct to study life in all its unforced manifestations,
and the instinct to question all conventions,
lie at the root of his work. It is in virtue of these that
he has been called enigmatic. Like Renan he was
ἀνὴρ δίψυχος, a man of two souls<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>; but he is no more
an enigma than others. His peculiarity lies herein,
that the duality of nature often found in ordinary men
was by him exhibited at the heights of genius. That
is why he so often seems labouring to destroy the
effect he has created; he is “inconsistent” because he
is equally at home in the two worlds of feeling and
of thought. Precisely for this reason he created a new
type of drama. Horace Walpole wrote that “Life is
a comedy to those who think, a tragedy to those who
feel”; thus, when a genius of Euripides’ type addressed
itself to the theatre, the result was drama which could
not but shock people who, bred in the school of Æschylus,
had no conception of “tragedy” which could be witty,
light, modern, destructive. Menander is the successor
of Euripides, not of Aristophanes.</p>

<p>Anyone who follows out these two strands of instinct
will understand much that might seem strange, much
that gave offence, in his work. It will be well therefore
to bring together the faults which have been found with
him in ancient and in later times. Leaving on one
side, since it is by no means certainly a reproach, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
celebrated remark<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> of Sophocles, “I represent people as
they should be, Euripides as they are,” we find our chief
material in Aristophanes and Aristotle. The <i>Frogs</i>
contains an elaborate attack upon the tragedian which,
whether fair or not, has a <i>prima facie</i> reasonableness.
Euripides is twitted with moral and literary offences.
In the first place, his predilection for depicting the power
of love, especially the adulterous or incestuous passions
of women<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> and the sophistical restlessness of mind which
he inculcates,<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> mark him as a corrupter of Athens. On
the technical side, his music<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> is affected and decadent,
the libretto<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> of his choruses is both elaborate and
jejune, the style of his iambics<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> lacks weight and dignity,
his prologues<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> are tiresome and written in a mechanical
fashion. Aristotle in his turn objects to certain weaknesses
of characterization: Menelaus in the <i>Orestes</i> is
particularly bad, the speech of Melanippe—no doubt
that celebrated oration on miracles—is indecorous and
out of character; in the Aulid <i>Iphigenia</i> the heroine is
inconsistent.<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> He gives two examples<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> of the irrational,
Ægeus in the <i>Medea</i> and Menelaus once more in the
<i>Orestes</i>. Euripides’ use of the <i>deus ex machina</i> is also
often bad; he instances Medea’s miraculous chariot.
Lastly there is the famous mixture<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> of praise and
blame: “Euripides, faulty as he is in the general
management of his subject, is yet felt to be the most
tragic of the poets.” If we pass now to modern detractors,
we find one fault overshadowing all the
rest—bad construction, what Aristotle calls “episodic”
plots, namely, plays the several scenes of which are
more or less accidentally combined and form no organic
whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>There is truth in some of this fault-finding; whether
we are to regard such features as actually blemishes is
another matter. Two certainly are defects of the
gravest possible description—“episodic” plots and the
<i>deus ex machina</i>. If a man produces plays which have
no organic unity, or which at the close of the action are
in such a tangle that a being of superhuman information
and power is necessary to “cut the knot,” he is no
“unskilful dramatist” but merely a blockhead, for he can
always fling his rubbish into the fire. So hopelessly
damaging are these two accusations that one really
cannot believe Euripides obnoxious to them. One
might as well allege that Alexander did not understand
tactics, or that Pericles believed Byzantium was in
Sicily. The charge of faulty construction has been
considered earlier in connexion with the plays which
are supposed examples thereof. But the <i>deus ex machina</i>
needs a few words. “The god out of the machine” is
a phrase of two applications. It may mean a deity
brought in to round off the play by giving information
about the future history of the personages. Or the god
may be introduced when the plot, owing to the human
limitations of the characters, has become knotted and
progress is impossible; then a being who miraculously
knows all the facts appears and “cuts” the knot. In
the first case the epiphany is practically outside the
drama; in the second it is only too vital to it. Of the
first case there are five<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> instances in the extant plays:
to these, of course, our grave objection cannot apply.
Of the second type there are seven<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> examples if we
regard the miraculous car of Medea as a “deus”.
<i>Granted the story which is known to the audience</i>, such
interventions are necessary. Medea cannot escape the
vengeance of Corinth, Orestes the verdict of the Argive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
State, without supernatural aid; Theseus would, it
might seem, never have been persuaded by mortal
witness that Hippolytus is innocent; in the Tauric
<i>Iphigenia</i> and the <i>Helena</i><a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> nothing but a miracle can
save from death the fugitives who as a matter of
“history” reached home in safety: the <i>Supplices</i> would
end without the formal compact between rescuers and
rescued if the goddess did not intervene; as for the
<i>Ion</i>, Euripides’ contemporaries knew that Delphi still
flourished, so that the annihilating investigation of Ion
must, it appeared, have been somehow arrested. For
these seven plays, then, we can choose between two
theories of the <i>deus ex machina</i> (in that second sense
of a pseudo-dramatic expedient). The first theory is
that the poet wishes to end with “historical” truth, but
in the course of his action has so blundered that he
cannot naturally do so; therefore he puts forward a
god who asserts that the action <i>shall</i> continue as
“history” asserts that it did; so might a competitor
in a match of archery employ a confederate who,
whenever his arrow missed the target, should pick
it up and plant it in the white. The other theory is
that Euripides intended to work out an interesting
situation of legend as a study in natural psychology and
social development. The situation according to story
came to a certain end; according to Euripides that was
not the natural end. And he emphasizes this legendary
distortion by pointing out clearly that to square nature
and the story nothing less than a miracle is required.
To assert that he needed the supernatural intervention
to save his play is absolutely to reverse the facts.
Can we doubt which of these theories is sound?</p>

<p>Two further questions at once arise. Why did
he select situations from misleading legends? And,
is there then no pseudo-dramatic <i>deus ex machina</i> at
all? The first question is of vital importance. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
incorrect to say that he was bound by convention
to the traditional stories; Phrynichus, Agathon, and
Moschion all defied this “convention”. Euripides was
a student of human thought, of the development of
belief, as well as a dramatist. Convinced that his
contemporaries held false beliefs about the gods and
that the myths were largely responsible for this, hypnotizing
thought by their beauty and paralyzing logic
by their authority, he sets himself to show, not only
that they are untrue, but also how, though untrue,
they ever won credence. As for the <i>deus ex machina</i>
the truth is that he does not exist (save, of course, in
the rôle of a non-dramatic narrator). He is, like the
three unities, a figment based on uncritical and hasty
reading. Outside this poet the only possible case
is that of the <i>Philoctetes</i>, which has been shown no
genuine instance.</p>

<p>We may now return to the objections raised by
Aristophanes and Aristotle. They are all due to the
two instincts we have described—his interest in every
manifestation of life, and his stern rationalism. Most
of the technical flaws, for instance, alleged against
him are proofs that he was attracted by the possibilities
of his own art; he is constantly testing the limits to
which development can go. The iambics of the <i>Orestes</i>,
for example, are extraordinarily full of resolved feet;
after that play he restrains himself more. In music
too he appears to have been an explorer; at any
rate the fault found with the words of his choruses
points to a development like the modern, in which
libretto was becoming subservient to music. The
comic poet, again, fastens eagerly upon the prologues,
and puts into the mouth of Æschylus a famous jest:—<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Æsch.</i>: And now, by Jove, I’ll not smash each
phrase word by word, but with heaven’s aid I’ll ruin
your prologues with—a little oil-flask.</p>

<p><i>Eur.</i>: An oil-flask? You ... my prologues?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p><i>Æsch.</i>: Just one little flask. You write so that
anything will fit into your iambics—a little fleece, a
little flask, a little bag. I’ll show you on the spot.</p>

<p><i>Eur.</i>: Oh! you will?</p>

<p><i>Æsch.</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Dion.</i>: Now you must recite something.</p>

<p><i>Eur.</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ægyptus, as the far-spread story tells,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Landing at Argos....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Æsch.</i>: (interrupting) ... “lost his flask of oil”.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Several other absurd instances follow.</p>

<p>This celebrated jest means (i) that Euripides constructs
the early sentences of his prologue in such a
way that a subordinate clause (usually containing a
participle) leads up to a short main clause at the end
of the sentence; (ii) that his prologues descend to
trivial details; (iii) that the <i>cæsura</i> occurs always in the
third foot; (iv) that he is viciously addicted to resolved
feet. The tragedian can be defended from these
charges, such as they are, but the idea at the back of
Aristophanes’ mind is true, namely, that these prologues
are often dull performances. Probably the
poet did not intend much more. He wishes to put
his hearers <i>au fait</i> with the precise legend and the
precise point with which he is concerned;<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> as is often
said, these passages take the place of a modern play-bill.</p>

<p>Later in the <i>Frogs</i> Dionysus produces a huge pair
of scales; each is to utter a line into his scale-pan, and
the heavier line wins. Euripides declaims into his pan
the opening line of the <i>Medea</i>, εἴθ’ ὤφελ’ Ἀργοῦς μὴ
διαπτάσθαι σκάφος, and his rival Σπερχειὲ ποταμὲ
βουνομοί τ’ ἐπιστροφαί. Dionysus absurdly explains
that the latter wins because he has put in water like a
fraudulent woollen-merchant, while Euripides has offered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
a “word with wings”. Underlying this nonsense is
the truth that the Æschylean line is ponderous and
slow, that of Euripides light and rapid; it is like contrasting
Marlowe and Fletcher. The difference is not
between good and bad, but between old and new.
Æschylus’ iambic style is fitted most admirably for his
purpose. But Euripides has not the same purpose—that
is all. It is one of his most remarkable innovations
that he practically invented the prose-drama. A very
great deal of his “verse” is simply prose which can be
scanned. To compare such a passage<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

</div>

<p class="noindent">or a hundred others, with the beacon-speech in <i>Agamemnon</i>
or Athena’s charge to the Areopagite court, is to
ignore the whole point of a literary revolution. Who
would set a page of Hedda Gabler’s conversation against
an extract from <i>Macbeth</i>, and affirm that Ibsen could
not write dialogue?</p>

<p>Ibsen, indeed, it is particularly instructive to bear in
mind here. According to him “the golden rule is that
there is no golden rule”.<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Dr. Stockman’s nobility
consists in telling the truth at all costs. Gregers Werle
insists on that course, and is seen to be a meddlesome
prig who ruins his friend’s home. Here the Greek and
the Norwegian agree heartily; for the “sophistry”
with which many at Athens were disgusted is only
Euripides’ way of putting his conviction that there is no
fixed rule of conduct, still less any fixed rule for our
self-satisfied attempts to praise or blame the abnormal.
An impulse of pity ruins Creon in the <i>Medea</i>; Lycus
in the <i>Heracles</i> turns his back on mercy, and is
destroyed also. The pride of glorious birth nerves
Macaria to heroism; of Achilles it makes merely
a pathetic sham. Consciousness of sin wrecks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
tortures Phædra, while to Helen in <i>Orestes</i> it means
little more than a picturesque melancholy. Hermione
in <i>Andromache</i> and Creusa both go to all lengths in
their passionate yearning for domestic happiness; one
destroys her husband and her own future, the other
reaps deeper bliss than she dared to hope. Iphigenia
and Hippolytus serve the same goddess, but amid what
different atmospheres and diverse destinies! This consciousness
that effort brings about results different from
its aims, that chance, whatever chance may be, is too
potent to allow any faith in orthodox deities, only in
moods of despair wrings from the poet such outcry as
Hecuba’s, that Fate is “a capering idiot”.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> But it has
planted surely in his mind the conviction that there is
no golden rule of conduct. And hence that “love of
forensic rhetoric” of which we hear so much—each case
must be considered on its own merits.</p>

<p>To this agnosticism we owe not only that treatment
of religious legend which we have already studied
but the poet’s greatest achievement. Socrates, because,
as he said, he could not understand metaphysics or
astronomy, gave his attention to man. His friend
because he despaired of a satisfying theology threw his
genius into psychological drama. The centre of his
interest is the human heart. Only one fact about
destiny can be stated as consistently held by him,
namely, that the spring of action and the chief factor in
happiness or misery is, not the will of Heaven or dogmatic
belief, but the nature (φύσις) of the individual.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>
Because he studies sin, not to condemn but to understand,
he has earned that reproach of Aristophanes who
rages at his predilection for Phædras and Sthenebœas.
What attracted him was not a desire to gloat or even to
pardon; it was the fact that the sinners he depicts are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
so intensely alive. A being dead in virtue engaged his
interest less than one who, however evilly, existed with
vigour. To this passionate interest in human life can
be referred as basis all the other themes on which he
spent study. Religion, as we have found, only attracts
him because it guides or misleads conduct. His political
studies have little concern with ethnology or economics;
they are only an expansion to a wider field of this same
interest in sheer humanity. Philosophy and natural
science are of value for him, as for Lucretius, in that
they provide an escape from paralyzing superstition.
If they are presented as a refuge from the facts of life,
he will have none of them. When Electra<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> seeks in her
knowledge of astronomy a far-fetched consolation for
self-fostered misery, she strikes us not as heroic but as
own kin to the febrile “intellectuals” of Tchekov’s
<i>Cherry Orchard</i> or the novels of Dostoevsky.</p>

<p>His dislike of convention in morals is answered by
his originality in portraiture as well as in dramatic
situations. Nothing is more thrilling than to observe how
in the hands of a great realist whole masses of human
beings come to life. What was the background of one
novelist suddenly begins in the pages of another to stir,
to articulate itself, to move forward and discover a
language. “The men” commanded by Captain Osborne
in <i>Vanity Fair</i> become Private Ortheris or
Corporal Mulvaney in the pages of Kipling. So in
Euripides the dim and familiar background of “barbarians”
who existed merely to give colour and outline
to Achilles and Odysseus, the women who bore the
necessary children and ground the needed flour, the
henchmen without whom horses would not be groomed
or trees felled, suddenly awake and reveal passions of
love and hatred, pathetic histories, opinions about
marriage and the grave. In every age the man who
points to the disregarded, the dormant, hitherto supposed
securely neutral and plastic, who cries “it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
alive, watching you and reflecting, waiting its time”—such
a man is met in his degree with the reception
given to Euripides by the elder generation of Athenians.
The clamour of “crank!” “faddist!” “this is the thin
end of the wedge,” and kindred watchwords, may be
found translated into brilliant Attic by Aristophanes.
But in virtue of these same interests Euripides became
the Bible of later Greek civilization. He would have
passed into a fetish had it not been that the destructively
critical side of his genius prevented the most
narrow-minded from reducing him to a system. To
the last he remains inconclusive, provocative, refreshing.</p>

<p>On the other side his sensitiveness to all aspects of
life—his “feeling for Beauty” to use the familiar phrase—held
him back from mere cynicism. The <i>Hippolytus</i>
remains as perhaps the most glorious support in literature
for unflinching facing of facts—it shows triumphantly
how a man may feel all the sorrow and waste which
wreck happiness, yet declare the endless value and
loveliness of life. We may detect two aspects in which
this joy in life shows itself most markedly—his romance
and his wit.</p>

<p>Romance is not improperly contrasted with “classicism,”
but as few Greek or Roman writers are classical
in the rigid sense it is not surprising to find romantic
features outcropping at every period of their literature.
Euripides himself is the most romantic author between
Homer and Appuleius, whatever our definition of
romance may be. R. L. Stevenson’s remark that
“romance is consciousness of background,” Hegel’s
doctrine that “romantic art is the straining of art to go
beyond itself,”<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> and a more recent <i>dictum</i> that “romance
is only the passion which is in the face of all realism,”<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>
each of them definitely recalls some feature of Euripides’
work already discussed. A modern writer with whom
he can be fruitfully compared, at this point especially,
is Mr Bernard Shaw. In many characteristics these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
two dramatists are notably alike: their ruthless insistence
upon questioning all established reputations, whether of
individuals, nations, or institutions; their conviction that
there is no absolute standard of conduct; their blazing
zeal for justice; their mastery of brilliant lithe idiom.
But in their feeling about romance they diverge violently.
Perhaps the largest ingredient in Mr. Shaw’s strength
is his hatred and distrust of emotion and of that spirit,
called romance, which organizes emotion and sees in
it a basic part of life. But Euripides appreciates it all
the more highly that he is not enslaved by it. Even in
such ruthless dramas as the <i>Medea</i> and the <i>Iphigenia in
Tauris</i> one remarks how the thrill and beauty of life
gleams out, if only as a bitter memory or a present pain
of contrast—the magic fire-breathing bulls and the heapy
coils of the glaring dragon in the remote land where
Jason won his quest, the strange seas, deserted beaches,
and grim savages among whom Iphigenia cherishes her
thoughts of childhood in Argos. The same sense of
glamour which inspires early in his life such a marvellous
flash as the description of Rhesus’ steeds:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">στίλβουσι δ’ ὥστε ποταμίου κύκνου πτερόν,<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and indeed the whole dashing buoyant drama—this
passion survives the shames and disillusionment wrought
by twenty-five years of tyranny and war; it persists
even in those black but glorious hours when he wrote
the <i>Troades</i> and at the close of his life culminates in the
splendours of the <i>Bacchæ</i>. No attentive student of his
work can ignore this effect, but if we possessed all his
plays we should be in no danger of accepting the idea
that Euripides is beyond all other things a bitter realist.
The <i>Andromeda</i> and the <i>Phaethon</i> would have redressed
the balance.</p>

<p>The wit of Euripides cannot easily be discussed; it
often depends upon idiomatic subtlety, and must almost
disappear in translation. But frequently, again, it consists
in the method of handling a situation. Just as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
the playwright often makes of his drama, among other
things, an elaborate <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of myth, so
is he capable of writing a whole scene with a twinkle in
his eye. The clearest example is the <i>Helena</i>; Menelaus’
stupefaction at learning that Egypt contains an Helen,
daughter of Zeus, is indeed definite comedy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Διὸς δ’ ἔλεξε παῖδά νιν πεφυκέναι.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἀλλ’ ἦ τις ἔστι Ζηνὸς ὄνομ’ ἔχων ἀνήρ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Νείλου παρ’ ὄχθας; εἷς γὰρ ὅ γε κατ’ οὐρανόν.<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“And she told me that the lady was a daughter of
Zeus! What! is there some person called Zeus living
beside the Nile? There’s one in Heaven, to be sure,
but that’s another story.” Such a translation gives
perhaps the intention of the words and colloquial rhythm
of the last sentence. Here is comedy, but that of Congreve,
not of Aristophanes. The distinction is important.
Euripides is less comic than witty. As we turn
his pages we rarely laugh, but a thousand times we
break into the slight smile of intellectual enjoyment;
one delight in reading an Euripidean play—tragedy
though it be—is the same as that aroused by the work
of Meredith. Euripides’ sense of the ludicrous is a part
of his restlessness in conception. Again and again he
startles us by placing at some tragic moment a little
episode which passes the pathetic and becomes absurd.
When Clytæmnestra and Achilles bring each other
into awkward perplexity over the espousal of Iphigenia
the effect is amusing, and the intervention of the old
slave who puts his head out of the tent-door must provoke
a smile, even though we realize that he has misery
and death on his lips.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> After Creusa has given her instructions
for the assassination of Ion, it is, though natural,
yet quaint for the prospective murderer to reply: “Now
do you retire to your hotel”.<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> In the <i>Medea</i> the whole
episode of Ægeus, to which Aristotle objected as “irrational,”
is tinged with the grotesque. That the horrible
story of Medea’s revenge must hang upon a slow-witted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
amiable person like Ægeus is natural to the topsy-turviness
of life as the dramatist saw it. In fact, just as
Euripides on the linguistic side practically invents the
prose-drama, so in the strictly dramatic sphere he
invents tragicomedy. Nothing can induce him to keep
tears and laughter altogether apart. The world is not
made like that, and he studies facts, depicting the
phases of great happenings not as they “ought to be”
but “as they are”. He would have read with amused
delight that quaint sentence of Dostoevsky: “All these
choruses sing about something very indefinite, for the
most part about somebody’s curse, but with a tinge of
the higher humour”.<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> It is indeed significant that
sparkles of incidental mirth are (so far as a modern
student can tell) commonest in that most heartbreaking
play <i>Orestes</i>. One dialogue between Orestes and
Menelaus, to take a single passage, is a blaze of wit—it
exemplifies every possible grade of witticism, from
the downright pun<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> to subtle varieties of iambic
rhythm. Perhaps the most light-hearted and entertaining
example<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> is provided by Helen who (of all casuists!)
evolves a theory of sin as a method of putting her
tigerish niece into good humour and so inducing her to
perform for Helen an awkward task. Even more skilful,
but ghastly in its half-farcical horror, is the dialogue
between Orestes and the escaped Phrygian slave.</p>

<p>Later ages of Greek civilization looked upon Euripides
as a mighty leader of thought, a great voice
expressing all the wisdom of their fathers, all the pains
and perplexities familiar to themselves. After generations
had passed it was easy to dwell upon one side only of
his genius, and for Plutarch or Stobæus to regard him
as the poet of sad wisdom:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent8">Amongst us one,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But his own contemporaries, living in the days before
Ægospotami and knowing the many facets of his spirit,
could not so well accept a man of such contradictions,
who was in strange earnest about things they felt to
be indifferent, and who smiled at such odd moments.
Euripides must often have felt himself very lonely in
Athens. “My soul,” he cries, “lay not hold upon words
of subtlety. Why admit these strange high thoughts,
if thou hast no peers for audience to thy serious musings?”<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>

</div>
</div>

<p>It may be that Europeans of our own day are better
fitted to estimate him aright than enthusiasts under the
Empire or his companions who saw him too close at
hand. During the last half-century we have witnessed
great changes which have their counterpart in the Athens
for which he wrote. Hopes have been realized only
to prove disappointments and the source of fresh perplexities.
In England the spread of knowledge has
resulted not in a cultivated, but in a mentally restless
people. Universal ability to read has for its most obvious
fruit not wider knowledge of literature, but more newspapers
and a rank jungle of “popular” writing. Similarly
at Athens the sophists had produced mental avidity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
where there was no quickening of spiritual vigour to
correspond. Another fact of vital import has been the
rise of our working-class to solidarity and political power:
it probably resembles that “demos” which Cleon led
more closely than “the masses” with which Peel or
Russell had to deal. Again, experience of war has
shown how small is the effect which settled government,
social reform, and education have exercised upon the
raw, primitive, human instincts, both base and noble. In
Greece, the empire of Athens, with its tyranny and
selfishness, and the Peloponnesian war which had produced
a frightful corruption of conduct and ideals,<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> tainted
society with that cynicism (ἀναίδεια) of which Euripides
so often speaks. Just as we are severed by a wide gulf
from the crude but not ignoble certainty, the superficial
worship of progress which marked the Victorian era, so
was Euripides severed from the “men of Marathon”
for whom Æschylus wrote.</p>

<p>So it is that we can judge the poet of “the Greek enlightenment”<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>—or
rather of the Athenian disillusionment—better
than most generations of his readers. To aid
us, there have naturally arisen writers to voice, in a
manner often like his, our own disappointment and our
renewed interest in parts of life and the world which we
had ignored as unmeaning or barren. The disinherited
are coming into their own. Mr. Thomas Hardy has
written of the English peasant with a richness and profundity
unknown since Shakespeare. He offers indeed
another interesting analogy with Euripides: while the
critics are concerned with his “pessimism” he remains
for an unsophisticated reader a splendid witness to the
majesty and charm of the immense slow curves of life,
the deep preciousness which glows from the gradual processes
of nature and that dignity of mere existence which
survives all sin and effort. <i>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
the best modern parallel to <i>Hippolytus</i>. Meanwhile M.
Anatole France has given us many an example of that
ironical wit of which the Greek poet is so consummate
a master. Another Frenchman, Flaubert, has set as
the climax to his dazzling phantasy, <i>La Tentation de
St. Antoine</i>, an expression in un-attic vehemence and
elaboration of that passionate sympathy with all existence
which blazes in the lyrics of the <i>Bacchæ</i>—a yearning
which Arnold in the <i>Scholar-Gipsy</i> has uttered in milder
and still more haunting language.</p>

<p>There is no final synthesis of Euripides. Throughout
his life he held true to those two principles, the
worship of beauty, and loyalty to the dry light of intelligence.
Glamour never blinded him to sin and folly;
misery and coarse tyranny never taught his lips to forswear
the glory of existence. One of his own noblest
songs sets this triumphantly before us<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>:—</p>

<span class="smaller">METRE AND RHYTHM IN GREEK TRAGEDY</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>§ I. <span class="smcap">Introduction</span></h3>

<p>Poetry is illuminating utterance consisting of
words the successive sounds of which are arranged
according to a recurrent pattern. The
soul of poetry is this illumination, its body this recurrent
pattern of sounds; and it is with the body that we are
now to deal. At the outset we must distinguish carefully
between rhythm and metre. Rhythm is the recurrence
just mentioned—the structure; metre is the gathering
together of sounds into masses upon which rhythm shall
do its work. Metre, so to put it, makes the bricks,
while rhythm makes the arch.</p>

<p>Greek metre is based, not upon stress-accent,<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> but
upon quantity—the length of time needed for the pronunciation
of a syllable. In English the line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is “scanned” (that is to say, marked off into “feet”—the
metrical units) as a series of five iambi; the iambus
being a foot which consists of an unaccented, followed
by an accented, syllable. The word “bosoms” can
stand where it does because the stress of the voice
naturally falls upon the first syllable of “bosom”; to
begin a line with “my seréne bosom” would clearly be
wrong. The <i>length</i> of the syllables has no effect on the
scansion. That “sits” needs as long a time for its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
utterance as the first syllable of “lightly” does not alter
the fact that “sits light-” is an accentual iambus.</p>

<p>Greek words, on the other hand, as metrical material,
are considered only from the quantitative point of view,
not the accentual. The voice-stress in the word λόγους
rests upon the first syllable, but the word is an iambus,
a “short” followed by a “long” (marked respectively
thus ⏑–). Whereas an English blank verse consists of
five accentual iambi, <i>e.g.</i></p>

<p class="center">To ént|ertaín | divíne | Zenócr|até,</p>

<p class="noindent">the corresponding verse of all the Greek dramatists is
composed of six feet each of which is theoretically a
quantitative iambus, and most of which actually are such.
Thus <i>Andromache</i>, v. 241 is to be scanned</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
⏑     –   ⏑   –  ⏑    – ⏑    – ⏑   –  ⏑ –
τι δ ου | γυναιξ|ι ταυτ|α πρωτ|α παντ|αχου.
</pre>
</div>

<p>When is a syllable long and when short? A few
rules will settle all but a minority. <i>All</i> syllables are
long—</p>

<p>(i) Which contain a necessarily long vowel (η or ω),
<i>e.g.</i> μη̄ν, τω̄ν.</p>

<p>(ii) Which contain a diphthong or <i>iota</i> subscript, <i>e.g.</i>
ο̅ι̅νος, α̅ι̅νο̅υ̅μεν, ρᾳ̅διως; save that the first syllable of ποιῶ
and τοιοῦτος (and their parts) is often short.</p>

<p>(iii) Which end with a double consonant (ζ, ξ, ψ),
<i>e.g.</i> ο̄ζος, ε̄ξω, ε̄ψαυσα.</p>

<p>(iv) Which have the circumflex accent, <i>e.g.</i> υμῖ̅ν, μῦ̅ς.</p>

<p><i>Most</i> syllables are long the vowel of which is followed
by two consonants. But there is some difficulty about
this very frequent case. It can arise in three ways:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Both consonants may be in the same word as the
vowel. Then the syllable is long, save when the consonants
are (i) a voiced stop (β, γ, δ) followed by ρ;
or (ii) a voiceless stop or spirant (κ, π, τ; θ, φ, χ)
followed by a liquid or nasal (λ, ρ, μ, ν)—in both of
which cases the syllable can be counted long or short at
pleasure. Thus ε̄σμεν, μο̄ρφη, ᾱνδρος; but the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
syllables of ιδρις, τεκνον, ποτμος are “doubtful”—they
can be either long or short as suits the poet.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) One of the consonants may end its word and
the other begin the next. Such syllables are <i>all</i> long.
Thus, τηκτο̄ς μολυβδος, ανδρε̄ς σοφοι, although both
these long syllables are “short by nature” (see below).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Both consonants may occur at the beginning of
the second word. If the vowel is naturally short, the
syllable is almost always short, though such scansions
as σε̄ κτενω are occasionally found. But if the second
word begins with a double consonant or σ followed by
another consonant, the syllable is always long. Thus
ο̄ ξενος, τῑ ζητεις, ταυτᾱ σκοπουμεν.</p>

<p>A vowel, naturally short, when thus lengthened is
said to be “lengthened by position.”</p>

<p>The following types of syllable are <i>always</i> short:—</p>

<p>(i) Those containing a naturally short vowel (ε or ο)
not lengthened by position, <i>e.g.</i> ε̆κων, ο̆λος.</p>

<p>(ii) Final α of the third declension neuter singular
(σωμᾰ), third declension accusative singular (ελπιδᾰ,
δρασαντᾰ), and all neuters plural (τᾰ, σωματᾰ, τοιαυτᾰ).</p>

<p>(iii) Final ι (<i>e.g.</i> εστῐ, τῐ), save, of course, when it is
part of a diphthong.</p>

<p>(iv) The accusative -ας of the third declension
(ανδρᾰς, πονουντᾰς). But μουσᾱς (first declension).
The quantity in both cases is that of the corresponding
nominative.</p>

<p>Hiatus is practically unknown. That is, a word
ending in a vowel is not to be followed by a word
beginning with a vowel, unless one vowel or the other
disappears. Almost always it is the first vowel which
is thus cut off, the process being called “elision.” In
verse one would not write πάντα εἶπε, but πάντ’ εἶπε;
not ἔτι εἶναι, but ἔτ’ εἶναι. When the first vowel is long
and the second short, the latter is cut off by “prodelision,”
a much rarer occurrence. Thus τούτῳ ἀνεῖπε would
become τούτῳ ’νεῖπε. Two long vowels, as in καλὴ
ἡμέρα, are not used together at all. But the rule as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
hiatus does not normally apply at the end of a verse;
usually one can end a verse with an unelided vowel and
begin the next with a vowel. If in any metrical scheme
this liberty is not allowed, it is said that “synapheia<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
prevails.”</p>

<p>We are now in a position to discuss the various
metres to be found in Greek Tragedy.</p>

<h3>§ II. <span class="smcap">The Iambic Metre</span></h3>

<p>Practically all the dialogue and speeches are written
in this metre. The student would do well to grow
thoroughly accustomed to reading these aloud with
correct quantities before he attempts the others.</p>

<p>The iambic line consists of six feet, any one of which
may be an iambus. But a “pure” iambic line, one in
which every foot is an iambus, as in <i>Andromache</i>, v. 241
(see above), is very rare. A speech written solely in
such feet would be highly monotonous and far too rapid.
Other feet are therefore allowed, under restrictions, to
take the place of the iambus.</p>

<p>By far the commonest of these is the spondee, which
consists of two long syllables (λο̄γχη̄, πᾱντω̄ν). This
can occur in the first, third, or fifth places—one, two, or
all three. Thus:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 – –     ⏑–    ⏑ –   ⏑   –     –  –   ⏑ –
<span class="u">δησαι</span> | βιᾳ | φαραγγ|ι προς | <span class="u">δυσχειμ</span>|ερῳ (<i>Prom. Vinctus</i>, 15).
</pre>
</div>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
–  –   ⏑  –   –   –     ⏑ –     ⏑–     ⏑ –
<span class="u">ω τεκν</span>|α Καδμ|<span class="u">ου του</span> | παλαι | vεα | τροφη (<i>Œd. Tyr.</i>, I).
</pre>
</div>

<p>Next, the lightness and variety is often greatly
increased by the use of “resolved”<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> (or broken-up) feet.
Each long syllable being regarded as equal to two
“shorts,” it follows that the iambus can be “resolved”
into ⏑⏑⏑, the spondee into –⏑⏑, ⏑⏑– (and ⏑⏑⏑⏑, but this
last is not employed in iambics).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<p>Of these three the tribrach (⏑⏑⏑) is much the most
frequent. As it corresponds to the iambus, it can occur
in any place, save the sixth; it is exceedingly rare in
the fifth place:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –   –  ⏑   ⏑ ⏑ –   –   ⏑  –   –  –     ⏑ –

</pre>
</div>

<p>The dactyl (–⏑⏑) is allowed in those places to which
the spondee is admitted, save the fifth (just as the
tribrach is excluded from the sixth). Thus:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
–   –  ⏑   –  –   ⏑ ⏑ ⏑  –   –  –    ⏑ –
ου φασ|ι πρωτ|<span class="u">ον Δανα</span>|ον Αιγ|υπτῳ | δικας (<i>Orestes</i>, 872).
</pre>
</div>

<div class="pre-container">

</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is rare in the first foot.</p>

<p>Least common of all is the anapæst (⏑⏑–), which
appears only in the first foot, unless it is contained
entirely in a proper name, when it can occur in any
place save the sixth. This license is due to necessity:
such a name as Ἀντῐγόνη could not otherwise be introduced
into iambics at all. Examples:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
  ⏑ ⏑ –       ⏑–     ⏑  –  ⏑ –    –  –   ⏑ –

</div>

<p>Occasionally a line is to be found with two or even
three resolved feet:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –   –   ⏑  ⏑ ⏑  –   ⏑ ⏑  ⏑ –     ⏑ –   ⏑  –

</pre>
</div>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>

αναδελφ|ος απατ|ωρ αφιλ|ος ει | δε σοι | δοκει (<i>Ibid.</i>, 310).
</pre>
</div>

<p>Two licenses should be noted. The last syllable of
the line may be short; no doubt the pause<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> at the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
was felt to help it out. Lines of this kind are innumerable,
<i>e.g.</i>:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
                                 ⏑⏑
Κρατος Βια τε σφῳν μεν εντολη | Διος (<i>Prom. Vinctus</i>, 12)
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(which is followed by a vowel—ἔχει). It matters little
whether such syllables are marked as short, as long, or
with the sign of doubtful quantity ( ᷋). Next, synizesis
(συνίζησις, “collapse”) occurs now and then—two
syllables coalesce and are scanned as one, <i>e.g.</i> μ̅η̅ ̅ο̅υ̅,
πολε̅ω̅ς:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
–    –    ⏑  –     –  –    ⏑ –     –  –   ⏑ –
αλλ <span class="u">εα</span> | με και | την εξ | εμου | δυσβουλ|ιαν (<i>Antigone</i>, 95).
</pre>

<div class="pre-container">

σφαζ αιμ|ατου | θ<span class="u">εα</span>ς βωμ|ον η | μετεισ|ι  σε (<i>Andromache</i>, 260).
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(Synizesis is specially common in the various cases of
θεός and θεά.)</p>

<p>Finally, two important rules of rhythm remain to be
stated.</p>

<p>First, there must be a “cæsura”<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> in either the third
or the fourth foot. A cæsura is a gap between words
in the middle of a foot. Either the third foot, then,
or the fourth must consist partly of one word, partly of
another. It is indicated in scansion by the sign ‖.
Many verses have this necessary cæsura in the third
foot only, <i>e.g.</i>:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
⏑ –     ⏑  –   –     –  ⏑ –   – –      ⏑ ⏑
απανθ | ο μακρ|ος ‖ καν|αριθμ|ητος | χρονος (<i>Ajax</i>, 646).
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Many show it in the fourth only:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
  –   –   ⏑  –     ⏑ –   ⏑    –    –  –    ⏑  ⏑
προς τησδ|ε της | γυναικ|ος ‖ οικτ|ειρω | δε νιν (<i>Ibid.</i>, 652).
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A still larger number have cæsura in both places:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
  –  –    ⏑ –  –     –  ⏑    –     –  –  ⏑ ⏑
φρουρας | ετει|ας ‖ μηκ|ος ‖ ην | κοιμωμ|ενος (<i>Agamemnon</i>, 2).
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This usage is essential to rhythm. It is of course possible
for every foot in the line to exhibit a cæsura, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
one in the midst is necessary to prevent the line from
falling into pieces. That coextension of word and foot
which is naturally frequent must at one point be emphatically
excluded, so that the whole line may be felt
as a single rhythmical whole. Such “lines” as</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  –  ⏑ –   ⏑ –   ⏑ –   –  –  ⏑ ⏑
ταυτην αναξ λεγει καλην ειναι πολιν,
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
⏑ –  ⏑–   –  –   ⏑ –  ⏑ –   ⏑ ⏑

</div>

<p class="noindent">are utterly impossible.<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> The first falls into six scraps,
and the second into two mere lumps, of equal length. If
a breach of the rule ever occurs, it is for a special reason.
When Sophocles (<i>Œd. Tyr.</i>, 738) writes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ὦ Ζεῦ, τί μου δρᾶσαι βεβούλευσαι πέρι;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the dragging rhythm well represents the dawning dread
of Œdipus. But the main cæsura may be dispensed
with if the third foot ends with an elision, apparently
because, if the word could be written in full, the fourth
foot would be divided between two words. Thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">χαῖρ’· οὐ γὰρ ἐχθαίρω σ’· ἀπώλεσας δ’ ἐμέ (<i>Alcestis</i>, 179).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ζητοῦσι τὸν τεκόντ’· ἐγὼ δὲ διαφέρω (<i>Heracles</i>, 76).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The other rule is that generally called “the rule of
the Final Cretic”.<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> It is most simply stated thus: if
there is a cæsura in the fifth foot, that foot must be an
iambus, <i>e.g.</i>:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
                            ⏑    –   ⏑ –
μη με̄ στυγησῃς· ουχ εκων | γαρ ‖ αγγ|ελω (<i>Troades</i>, 710).
</pre>
</div>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
                           ⏑    –     ⏑ –
τον τουδε νεκρον ουκ αθαπτ|ον ‖ αν | λιποις (<i>Ibid.</i>, 738).
</pre>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>This rule does not exclude from the first half of the foot
long <i>monosyllables</i> which are in meaning and syntax
closely connected with the “cretic” word or words.
Thus τῶν σωμάτων is a quite correct ending, but not
τούτων σωμάτων.</p>

<p>Subjoined is a scheme of the iambic verse as written
by the tragedians. The writers of comedy allowed
themselves licenses with which we are not here concerned.
Euripides is much fonder of resolved feet than
Æschylus or Sophocles.</p>

<h3>§ III. <span class="smcap">The Trochaic Tetrameter</span></h3>

<p>Under this head we shall deal only with trochees as
used in dialogue. Originally all dialogue was written
in this metre,<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> and they sometimes appear in extant
plays when the situation is too hurried or excited for
iambics though not agitated enough for lyrical dialogue.
These passages are not usually long, and it
is interesting to note that the longest are found in
the two most melodramatic plays, <i>Orestes</i> and <i>Iphigenia
at Aulis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> The metre is always the trochaic
tetrameter catalectic<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> (sometimes called the trochaic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
octonarius), that is, a line consisting of eight feet, mostly
trochees, with “catalexis”. Catalexis occurs when the
last foot of a line has not its full number of syllables,
the remainder being filled by a pause in delivery.</p>

<p>Pure trochaic verses are occasionally to be found:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 – ⏑    –  ⏑  – ⏑  –  ⏑    –  ⏑    –   ⏑  – ⏑  –
κατα | πως αφ|ικομ|εσθα | δευρο | ταυτ αμ|ηχαν|ωꞈ| (<i>Ion</i>, 548).
  1      2     3    4      5        6      7   8
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The mark ꞈ means that there is a pause equivalent in
length to a short syllable. It is often found in the
scansion of lyrics, and there one also at times uses
-̭ ⏗̭ ⏘̭, which mean pauses equivalent to two, three, and
four short syllables respectively. As in iambics, the
last syllable may be short by nature:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
–  ⏑    –  ⏑  –     ⏑  –  ⏑    –  ⏑     –  ⏑ –   ⏑  ⏑–

<p>The tribrach also is often employed by Euripides:—</p>

<p>The fifth foot is the favourite place for the tribrach,
and next to that the first:—</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p>Euripides, late in his career, introduced a good deal
of license, here as elsewhere. Firstly, tribrachs become
far more frequent and occur in unusual places:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>

</pre>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">To place a resolved foot practically at the end of the
line is bold—the metre is shaken almost to pieces.
Here, as in other respects, Euripides points forward to
the conversational manner of the New Comedy. But
he goes further, and allows feet hitherto not found in
trochaics: the anapæst and the dactyl. The latter,
however, is extremely rare<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> and employed only with
proper names:—</p>

<p>The anapæst is commoner (there is a proper-name
instance in the line just quoted):—</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p>There is no rule as to cæsura. The end of the
fourth foot regularly coincides with the end of a word;
such an arrangement is named diæresis.<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> In all extant
tragedy only one certain exception to this rule is found:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>

</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Since diæresis is practically always found in so many
hundreds of lines, being preserved even in the loosest
writing of Euripides, why should we regard the recognized
trochaic verse as an unity? Why not write,
<i>e.g.</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">οὐ γὰρ ἂν ξυμβαῖμεν ἄλλως</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἢ ’πὶ τοῖς εἰρημένοις,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ὥστ’ ἐμὲ σκήπτρων κρατοῦντα</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">τῆσδ’ ἄνακτ’ εἶναι χθονός (<i>Phœnissæ</i>, 590 <i>sq.</i>).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If the line falls into two clearly marked halves, why not
show this to the eye? There is no unanswerable
objection to doing so—the passage above corresponds
exactly in rhythmical form to much English verse,
<i>e.g.</i>:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Art is long, and Time is fleeting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And our hearts, though stout and brave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still, like muffled drums, are beating</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Funeral marches to the grave.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The practice in English is to break up the long trochaic
“line” into two when the words at the diæresis rhyme
(as in the above passage from Longfellow), but not to
do so when the only rhymes occur at the catalectic foot.
We print the opening of another poem by Longfellow
thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In the market-place of Bruges stands the belfry old and brown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded, still it watches o’er the town.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In Greek there is, of course, no rhyme-scheme to settle
this, but the regular catalexis is felt to mark off separate
units. The entire question depends upon personal
fancy,<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> though the instance from the <i>Philoctetes</i> shows
that Sophocles at any rate regarded the whole octonarius
as the unit.</p>

<p>Subjoined is the scheme:—</p>

<h3>§ IV. <span class="smcap">The Anapæstic Metre</span></h3>

<p>Whereas iambics and trochaics were declaimed by
the actors, anapæsts were used mostly by the chorus,
and were chanted in recitative. They are found when
the chorus move into the orchestra, or salute the entrance
of a new character. Most tragedies end with a brief
anapæstic system, executed by the singers as they
depart.</p>

<p>The most usual line is a tetrapody—that is, a verse
of four feet:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 ⏑  ⏑   –     ⏑ ⏑  –      ⏑  ⏑  –  ⏑  ⏑ –
τι συ προς | μελαθροις | τι συ τῃδ|ε πολεις; (<i>Alcestis</i>, 29).
</pre>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But lines consisting of anapæsts alone are very uncommon.
The spondee is often found:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
–   –   ⏑ ⏑  –     ⏑ ⏑  –   – –
ουκ ηρκ|εσε σοι | μορον Αδμ|ητου (<i>Alcestis</i>, 32).
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Dactyls also are frequent:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
  – –   ⏑  ⏑  –    –    ⏑ ⏑    –  –
σφηλαντ|ι τεχνῃ | νυν δ επι | τῃδ αυ (<i>Ibid.</i>, 34).
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">No other foot is admitted, but each of these three may
occur at any place in the line.</p>

<p>Besides the tetrapody, we find now and then a
dipody, or verse of two feet.</p>

<p>Anapæstic systems are invariably closed by a catalectic
verse:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
–  –     ⏑ ⏑ –      ⏑ ⏑–     –
αυτη | προθανειν | Πελιου | παιςꞈ̄ (<i>Ibid.</i>, 37).
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In systems of considerable length such lines occur at
intervals. They are called “parœmiacs”.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<h3>§ V. <span class="smcap">Lyrics</span></h3>

<p>The metres of Greek songs form a difficult and
complicated study. So long as we do not know the
music composed for them, the scansion of lyrics must
remain a more difficult and doubtful question than that
of the iambics, episodic trochaics, and anapæsts.</p>

<p>The best preparation for their study is the habit of
reading iambics and trochaics with correct quantities
and natural emphasis. Let us, so prepared, address
ourselves to the following passage<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> from the <i>Agamemnon</i>
(975 <i>sqq.</i>):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Τίπτε μοι τόδ’ ἔμπεδον</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">δεῖμα προστατήριον</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">καρδίας τερασκόπου ποτᾶται;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">μαντιπολεῖ δ’ ἀκέλευστος ἄμισθος ἀοιδά,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">οὐδ’ ἀποπτύσαι δίκαν</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">δυσκρίτων ὀνειράτων</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">θάρσος εὐπειθὲς ἵζει φρενὸς φίλον θρόνον;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">χρόνος δέ τοι πρυμνησίων ξυνεμβολαῖς</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">ψαμμίας ἐξ ἀκτᾶς βέβηκεν, εὖθ’ ὑπ’ Ἴλιον</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">ὦρτο ναυβάτας στρατός.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span></p>

<p>It soon becomes plain that the passage is, at any
rate in the main, trochaic. The first two lines scan
easily, ending with a catalectic foot. We note that the
third seems to drag at the end:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  ⏑ –   ⏑  –  ⏑  –   ⏑  – –
καρδι|ας τερ|ασκοπ|ου ποτ|αται,
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">for we remember that in the trochaic octonarius the last
complete foot is never a spondee. But in the fourth
line we are quite baffled:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  ⏑  ⏑ –      ⏑ ⏑ –
μαντιπ|ολει δ | ακελευστ|ος...?
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Anapæsts are very rare in trochaics, iambi unknown.
That the iambus should never replace the trochee is
quite natural. It would be hideous rhythm, in the first
line of <i>Locksley Hall</i>, instead of “Cómrades, leave me
here a little ...,” to write “Dragoóns, leave me ...”.
The foot ο̆λεῑ cannot be right. The line seems hopeless;
or rather, if we have any knowledge of Homeric and
Virgilian metre, we recognize something like the dactylic
hexameter:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  ⏑ ⏑  –    ⏑ ⏑  –   ⏑  ⏑  –  ⏑  ⏑ –  –
μαντιπολ|ει δ ακελ|ευστος αμ|ισθος α|οιδα.
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But is such a passage possible in a trochaic passage
written for Greek music? It is known that in Greek
music the notes corresponded closely to the syllables;
music composed for trochees will certainly be in three-eighths
time, for dactyls in four-eighths time. All these
feet should have three beats, not four.</p>

<p>The next two lines are plainly similar to the first
and second. In the seventh line we first wonder why,
though we are in the midst of a grammatical sentence,
the words should begin farther to the right than is usual,
as if for a new paragraph. When we try to scan, we
find once more the iambus-difficulty:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  ⏑    –  –   ⏑  –
θαρσος | ευπειθ|ες ιζ....
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If we work backwards from the end, -ος φιλον θρονον
gives the familiar trochaic-octonarius ending, –⏑|–⏑|–ꞈ.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
But the middle of the line has fallen to pieces, and for
the present we leave it.</p>

<p>The eighth line seems at first more familiar. Is it
not the ordinary iambic senarius of § II? But where is
the cæsura? And can we suddenly insert an iambic
line into a trochaic system? Is it then possible after all
to scan it as some kind of trochaics? Begin at the end.
... ε̅μ̅βο̆λα̅ι̅ςꞈ suits excellently; and if we work backwards
we soon find that the whole would fall readily
into trochaics if only we could ignore the first syllable:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
    –   ⏑    –    –   – ⏑ –   ⏑  –  ⏑  –
χρονος δε | τοι προμν|ησι|ων ξυν|εμβο|λαιςꞈ
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But why should we ignore it? And why does the line
begin farther to the left?</p>

<p>The ninth line again offers perplexity in the first
half, clearness in the second:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
– ⏑    –   ⏑    – ⏑  ᷋
ηκεν | ευθ υπ | Ιλι|ονꞈ.
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Grown by this time bolder, we attack the first half in
detail, working backwards. ᾱς βε̆ is easy. Then ἐξ
ακτ ... may be either –⏑ or – –, both of which are
admissible. We are left with ψ̅α̅μμῐᾱς. Reading the
whole line over slowly, marking the trochees carefully,
we find ourselves somehow dwelling on the last syllable
of ψαμμίας. Why should we? If that syllable were
only –⏑, all would be well; but it is not. Finally, the
tenth and last line is quite easy:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
–  ⏑    –  ⏑  –     ⏑  ⏑–
ωρτο | ναυβατ|ας στρατ|οςꞈ.
</pre>
</div>

<p>The whole passage then is trochaic; but we have
met four difficulties: (i) the necessity to dwell upon
certain syllables, (ii) the irrational presence of dactyls,
(iii) the temptation to ignore the first syllable of χρόνος,
(iv) the insetting of θάρσος. Understanding of these four
facts will carry us a long way. We take them in order.</p>

<p>Our first point indicates that we must revise that
division of all syllables into “longs” of equal value and
“shorts” of equal value (each “long” being exactly
equivalent to two “shorts”) which obtains in iambics.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
The lyric metres recognize syllables of greater length
than ⏑⏑. Most frequent is the length ⏗, equal to ⏑⏑⏑.
A syllable of this length is therefore admitted in lyric
trochaic systems as a whole foot, and investigations, such
as we have practised above, will generally show where
such a foot is to be postulated. We can now scan
certain portions which we found troublesome:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  ⏑    ⏗     –  ⏑    ⏗
θαρσος | ευπ | ειθες | ιζ | ...
</pre>
</div>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  ⏑ ⏗    –  ⏑     –
ψαμμι|ας | εξ ακτ | ας....
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Moreover, as we were suspicious of the final spondee
(replacing the expected trochee) in the third line, we
obtain at any rate a quasi-trochee by scanning thus:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  ⏑ –   ⏑  –  ⏑  –   ⏑  ⏗  –
καρδι|ας τερ|ασκοπ|ου ποτ|ατ|αιꞈ.
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This prolongation of a syllable is called τονή (“stretching”).
Such a syllable may fill a foot, as in trochaics,
and this rhythm is said to be syncopated.<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>Next comes the dactylic fourth line, which introduces
another vital rule. Trochaic systems admit, not genuine
dactyls, but “cyclic” dactyls. To the “long” of each
foot and to the first “short” is given less than their
usual length: the rhythm is accelerated, so that –⏑ is
equivalent to –, and the whole cyclic dactyl, marked  ᷋⏑,
is equivalent to a trochee.<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> Whenever we see a number
of apparent dactyls, we must examine the whole passage
to find whether it is trochaic or not. Trochaic systems
which contain cyclic dactyls are called “logaoedic”.<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>
The present line, then, being trochaic, we feel the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
doubt of the final spondee (which would equal ⏑⏑⏑⏑,
not ⏑⏑⏑, as it should) which we felt in the third line,
and scan the whole:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –  ⏑ ⏑   – ⏑   ⏑   –  ⏑  ⏑  –  ⏑   ⏑ ⏗   –
μαντιπολ|ει δ ακελ|ευστος αμ|ισθος  α|οιδ|αꞈ.
</pre>
</div>

<p>Our third question touched the first syllable of χρόνος
in the sixth line. It is, as a fact, to be regarded as
standing outside the metrical line—a kind of prelude,
called “anacrusis”.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> It is plain that neglect of anacrusis
will often throw our scansion out completely. A useful
rule can be given: in almost<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> any line, whatever comes
before the first long syllable forms an anacrusis. The
reason is that the first syllable of a foot must have an
“ictus” (see below) or stress-accent, and the foot-ictus
normally falls on long syllables. It becomes natural then
to pronounce the first short or shorts (if any) quickly,
and to give the first long the ictus; in this way the short
is felt as a mere preliminary to the line. The anacrusis,
however, can be of three forms, ⏑, ⏑⏑, –. Its length
must be that of the second part of the characteristic foot,
⏑ for trochees, – or ⏑⏑ for dactyls, and so forth. It is
marked off from the first foot by the sign ⁝.</p>

<p>The fourth point was the insetting of θάρσος.
It happens in the middle of a grammatical sentence,
so that there can be no question of an ordinary paragraph.
But if it does not point to a break in sense,
its only reference can be rhythmical. The whole passage
must fall into two distinct rhythmical paragraphs. Let
us scan them separately and endeavour to find a reason
for this break. Take the first, scanning, marking, and
numbering the feet:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span></p>

<p>If we examine this to find structural unity, it soon
appears. The first pair of lines answers to the last, and
line three to line four, in the number of their feet 4 + 4,
6, 6, 4 + 4. The correspondence is indicated thus:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">

<p class="noindent">Each of these masses, it will be noticed, is marked off
by the sign ‖. Such a mass is named a “sentence” or
“colon” (κῶλον, “limb”), and such a balanced structure
of cola is named a “period” (περίοδος, “circuit”). It
happens that in the passage just examined the “sentence”
division always occurs at the end of a word, but this
is not invariably so. We proceed now with the second

<p class="noindent">That is: 4 + 4, 6, 4 + 4, 4. This would be an obviously
well-balanced structure but for the last colon, to which
nothing corresponds. Such an extra sentence is called
a “postlude” (ἐπῳδικόν). Non-corresponding sentences
like this are far from rare.<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> They may occur at the
beginning of the period (“prelude,” προῳδικόν), in the
middle (“mesode,” μεσωδικόν), or at the end. This
very period supplies an example of a mesode as well as
of a postlude. The scheme is:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">

<p>The whole passage, then, consists of two periods
connected by meaning and grammar, but—for us—by
no more intimate musical bond than the common use
of trochees. But the dance and music which accompanied
the whole would clearly demonstrate its unity.
The end of a period is indicated by ‖.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to consider briefly the passage
which immediately follows (vv. 988 <i>sqq.</i>):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>This is an exact counterpart in syllables, feet, cola,
and periods, of the first passage. The first is called
the “strophe” (στροφή, “turn”), the second the “antistrophe”
(ἀντιστροφή, “counter-turn”). The chorus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
while singing the one, performed various evolutions
about the orchestra, and these were repeated exactly,
but in reversed order, while they sang the antistrophe.
All these lyrics are so constructed; the normal tragic
“chorus” consists of one or more such pairs, though
occasionally the antistrophe is followed by a passage
called an “epode”.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> The epodes correspond to each
other, not to the strophes. This equivalence of strophe
and antistrophe is often of value in determining the
quantities or the text in one of them.</p>

<p>We have now gained some insight into the nature
of a Greek choric song. But before proceeding further
it will be well to deepen our impression by taking from
the <i>Agamemnon</i> (vv. 160 <i>sqq.</i>) another, and a simpler,

<p>The chief interest of this subject is the art wherewith
the Greek masters accompanied variations of emotion
and the like with variations of rhythm. This passage
affords a simple and stately example. The heavy opening
(⏗⏗) is followed by the more confident trochees till,
at the last line but one, religious rapture (in the strophe)
and the ardour of triumph (in the antistrophe) burst
forth with the leaping cyclic dactyls.</p>

<p>We have now become acquainted with three rhythmical
masses: the colon, the period, the strophe. Are
there others? What is a “verse” in lyrics? There
is no such thing.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> One must, of course, distinguish
between a “line” and a “verse”. Lines there must
be—that is an affair of the scribe and the printer; verses
are rhythmical units, and there is no rhythmical mass in
Greek lyrics between the colon and the period. How
then are we to arrange our periods, there being no verse-division?
The most obvious way is to write each colon
as a separate line. The difficulty is that we shall often
be compelled to break words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">θάρσος εὐπειθὲς ἵζ-</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ει φρενὸς φίλον θρόνον ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ψαμμίας ἐξ ἀκτᾶς βέβ-</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ηκεν....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another method is to let each line run on until we reach
a colon-ending which coincides with a word-ending.
Here is no new rhythmical rule: it is purely a question
of convenience for the eye. Next, shall we ever write
lines of (say) two cola the first of which does close with
a word-ending? It is natural so to do when to the two
cola in question there correspond (whether periodically
or strophically) two cola which <i>must</i> on this system fill
one line only. For instance, in Æsch., <i>Supplices</i>, 656,
we shall write—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –   ⏑  ⏑ – ⏑ ⏗     –⏑   ⏑ –     ⏑ ⏗   –  ⏑ ⏑ – ⏑  –  ⏑–
και γαρ υποσκιων ‖ νυν στοματων ποτασθ‖ω φιλοτιμος ευχα ‖,
</pre>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">though the first colon ends at the end of ὑποσκίων,
because the corresponding passage of the antistrophe
runs—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
 –   ⏑ ⏑ –   ⏑   ⏗   – ⏑ ⏑ –   ⏑ ⏗     –⏑  ⏑ –    ⏑ –   ᷋
και γεραροι δε πρεσβ‖υτοδοκοι γεμοντ‖ων θυμελαι φλεγοντων ‖,
</pre>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where the first colon ends inside a word. It is purely a
matter of taste whether we give a line to each colon,
in which case the drawback is the breaking of words,
or continue our line till breaking of words is excluded,
the trouble about which method is the reader’s difficulty
in seeing where some of the cola begin.</p>

<p>We must now consider the most vital and difficult
portion of our subject. How are we to determine the
cola? The colon is the very soul of the rhythm. The
period is generally too long for the ear to receive it as
one artistic impression. The foot is too short; moreover,
the mere foot too often tends to play one false:
irrational syllables and τονή are against us. But the
colon is neither too long nor too short. The colon-division
serves the same purpose as non-commissioned
officers in a regiment, or the determination of watersheds
in geography—it gives a sense both of grouping
and of control.</p>

<p>What precisely <i>is</i> a colon? It is as much of a
strophe as can be uttered without making a new start.
It is the embodiment of rhythm, as the foot is the embodiment
of metre. In other words, it is a series of
feet bound into a rhythmical unity by the presence
of one main ictus. Three questions, then, arise. (i)
What is an ictus? (ii) Which is the main ictus of a
series? (iii) Can we with certainty determine the
beginning and end of a colon when we have identified
the main ictus?</p>

<p>(i) Ictus is stress-accent. The ictus of any single
word is usually obvious. In the word “maritime” it
falls upon the first syllable, in “dragoon” upon the
second, in “cultivation” upon the third. In πάντων,
λυσαμένοις, and κατάπαστος, it falls upon the first,
second, and third respectively. Greek metre is based<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
upon quantity, but Greek rhythm (like all other rhythm)
is based upon ictus. A strophe can, and must, be scanned
foot by foot on quantity alone; but when we go beyond
the foot-division to exhibit the structure of the whole,
we must refer to ictus and nothing but ictus—for structure
is an affair of cola, and the colon is created by the
main ictus.</p>

<p>(ii) Among the many word-ictuses of a considerable
passage, a few will be found which are heavier than the
rest. These are simply the ictuses of the most important
words. Each of these prominent ictuses gathers
the neighbouring minor ictuses into a group round itself.
We should begin then by fixing some obvious example,
one (that is) where the main ictus is unmistakable, and
on this basis attempt, by the help of the correspondences
which we expect, to determine other main ictuses. The
strophe will thus gradually fall into cola. This leads us
at once to our third question.</p>

<p>(iii) Can we with certainty determine the extent of
each colon? Unfortunately no simple invariable rule
can be given for the settlement of this vital point. But
certain useful principles may be mentioned.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A well-trained ear is the chief guide. Intelligent
and careful reading aloud of an English prose-passage
will show this. Take first (the best-known version of)
a famous sentence of John Bright:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Angel of Death is abroad in the land: you may almost hear the
beating of his wings.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is plain that this falls into two rhythmical parts, though
we shall not expect them to correspond, since this is
prose, not verse. If we set a dash for each syllable and
mark the ictuses by one or more dots according to their
strength, we find this scheme:—</p>

<p class="noindent">(Observe how, in the last two cola, first the mounting
and then the declining emphasis provide a splendid close.)</p>

<p>Let us now attempt so to catch the rhythm of a
passage from Sophocles (<i>Antigone</i>, 582 <i>sqq.</i>) if set out
as prose.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>εὐδαίμονες οἷσι κακῶν ἄγευστος αἰών. οἷς γὰρ ἂν σεισθῇ θεόθεν δόμος,
ἄτας οὐδὲν ἐλλείπει, γενεᾶς ἐπὶ πλῆθος ἕρπον· ὅμοιον ὥστε ποντίαις οἶδμα
δυσπνόοις ὅταν θρῄσσαισιν ἔρεβος ὕφαλον ἐπιδράμῃ πνοαῖς, κυλίνδει βυσσόθεν
κελαινὰν θῖνα, καὶ δυσάνεμοι στόνῳ βρέμουσιν ἀντιπλῆγες ἀκταί. ἀρχαῖα τὰ
Λαβδακιδᾶν οἴκων ὁρῶμαι πήματα φθιτῶν ἐπὶ πήμασι πίπτοντ’, οὐδ’ ἀπαλλάσσει
γενεὰν γένος, ἀλλ’ ἐρείπει θεῶν τις, οὐδ’ ἔχει λύσιν. νῦν γὰρ ἐσχάτας
ὑπὲρ ῥίζας ὃ τέτατο φάος ἐν Οἰδίπου δόμοις, κατ’ αὖ νιν φοινία θεῶν τῶν
νερτέρων ἀμᾷ κονίς, λόγου τ’ ἄνοια καὶ φρενῶν Ἐρινύς.</p>

</div>

<p>If we first mark the quantities (ignoring, as we must
at first, the possibility of ⏗ and ⏘) and go over the
whole carefully, we soon find that it falls into two corresponding
portions: εὐδαίμονες ... ἀκταί is the strophe,
ἀρχαῖα ... Ἐρινύς the antistrophe. Next we look for
rhythmical units. On the one hand, there is the great
difficulty that, since we must have both periodic and
strophic equivalence, certain cola may take in words not
belonging to the same sense-groups or grammatical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
clauses. On the other hand, the fact that we have two
great masses which correspond exactly will help us.
First, then, we note that εὐδαίμονες ... αἰών looks promising,
and observing that this points to ἀρχαῖα ...
ὁρῶμαι as a colon also, and that this is in itself likely, we
mark off both these groups. Conversely, at the end of
the antistrophe, λόγου ... Ἐρινύς attracts us, and this
is supported by the naturalness of στόνῳ ... ἀκταί at
the end of the strophe. Working backwards, and seeing
a pause in the punctuation at precisely the same place in
both halves, namely, after πνοαῖς and δόμοις, we assume
that κυλίνδει ... δυσάνεμοι and κατ’ αὖ ... κονίς are
correspondent masses. But each is too long—sixteen
syllables—to be pronounced as a unit. We soon perceive
that κυλίνδει ... κελαινάν, θῖνα ... δυσάνεμοι,
κατ’ αὖ ... τῶν, νερτέρων ... κονίς, are all separate
cola. Going backwards again, we find that ἐπιδράμῃ<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>
πνοαῖς and Οἰδίπου δόμοις, ὕφαλον ... πνοαῖς and
φάος ... δόμοις, Θρῄσσαισιν ... πνοαῖς and ῥίζας ...
δόμοις, and indeed longer masses still, all give a metrical
correspondence. Which pair are we to select? οἶδμα
... πνοαῖς (= νῦν ... δόμοις) is too long; ἐπιδράμῃ
πνοαῖς (= Οἰδίπου δόμοις) is too short. For we seek
the longest unit which is convenient. We therefore
mark off οἶδμα ... ὅταν, νῦν ... ὑπέρ, Θρῄσσαισιν
... πνοαῖς, ῥίζας ... δόμοις as cola. The same
method will give us ὅμοιον ... ποντίαις and θεῶν
... λύσιν. Then we find ourselves left with οἷς
γάρ ... ἕρπον and πήματα ... ἐρείπει, which we
divide after ἄτας and πίπτοντ’.</p>

<p>At last we can set out the passage according to its
structure. The strophe runs thus:—</p>

<p class="noindent">To this the antistrophe of course corresponds, though
here and there an irrational long corresponds to a short
(e.g. -εῑπε͐ι to ε̄ρπο̆ν); the last syllable of πήματα is
lengthened by the following φθ.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this scheme differs somewhat
from that given in Jebb’s edition of the <i>Antigone</i> (pp.
lxi. <i>sq.</i>). One reader’s ear differs from that of another:
hence the frequent divergencies to be observed between
editors in the arrangement of many lyrics.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The ancient writer Aristoxenus gives certain rules
as to the maximum length of cola. They may be stated
as follows:—</p>

<p>(i) There are three types of colon, the equal, the unequal,
and the quinquepartite. The equal cola are the
dipody of 1 + 1 feet, the tetrapody of 2 + 2; the unequal
are the tripody of 2 + 1, and the hexapody of 4 + 2; the
quinquepartite is the pentapody of 3 + 2.</p>

<p>(ii) Equal cola must not be of greater length than
sixteen “shorts”. Therefore we may have a dipody of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
any foot, and a tetrapody of any save those of more than
four shorts in value; that is (<i>e.g.</i>) a dipody of cretics
(–⏑–) is allowed, but not a tetrapody of that foot, which
would give 5 × 4 = 20 “shorts”.</p>

<p>(iii) Unequal cola may have the length of eighteen
“shorts”. A tripody, therefore, of any foot is allowed,
but a hexapody of trochees only: a hexapody of spondees
would give 4 × 6 = 24 “shorts”.</p>

<p>(iv) Quinquepartite cola may extend to the value of
twenty-five “shorts”. Pentapodies are therefore possible
of trochees, dactyls, spondees and five-time feet.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Certain detailed hints may be added:—</p>

<p>(i) The tetrapody is the most frequent length, the
pentapody the rarest.</p>

<p>(ii) The end of a colon is often indicated in dactyls
by a spondee, in trochees by a single long syllable
(whether ⏗ or –ꞈ).</p>

<p>(iii) In any one period there is a tendency to conformity
in length. If 6 + 5 + 4 and 6 + 6 + 4 are <i>prima
facie</i> equally possible, the latter is as a rule to be preferred.
In spite of the difference in sum-total (6 + 6 + 4
= 16; 6 + 5 + 4 = 15), this question often arises, because
of the possibility of τονή. It has to be decided<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> whether
(<i>e.g.</i>) παντός at the close of a colon is to be scanned as
two feet or one:</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
⏗  –

used in lyrics.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Trochees.</i>—With these we are now familiar.

being iambi,<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> without anacrusis trochees. The trochee
is the most frequent foot in lyrics. Such systems express
ordinary strong interest. Whenever more definite
emotion is to be conveyed, either cyclic dactyls are
introduced, or a change is made to some other metre:—</p>

<p class="noindent">We are forbidden to view the Greek cretics given above

<p class="noindent">But it should be noted that, though bacchiac scansion
seems soundest for the above—“storm-winds” for
instance has two ictuses—the poet probably meant the
lines for dactylic dipodies with anacrusis: “storm-winds
of” thus would be an accentual dactyl. But that would
slur “winds” unduly.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Ionics.</i>—These are formed by – –⏑⏑. When
anacrusis is found—the usual form—the foot is often
called <i>Ionicus a minore</i> (<i>i.e.</i> ⏑⏑– –); otherwise it is called

the Persian counsellors in expectation of Xerxes’ triumph,
and makes a strong contrast with the piteous rhythms
of the close. This poem should be studied carefully in
comparison with another in the same metre—the opening
of the first chorus in the <i>Bacchæ</i> (vv. 64 <i>sqq.</i>):—</p>

<p class="noindent">This song of the Bacchantes, like that of the Persians,
expresses both excitement and confidence; both are
magnificent, and the <i>metre</i> is the same. But the difference
is unmistakable; it lies in the <i>rhythm</i>. In Æschylus
the practically unvaried rhythm and the gorgeous
language give to such a passage as πολύχειρ καὶ πολυναύτας
Σύριόν θ’ ἅρμα διώκων an almost intolerable
weight and austere pomp. Euripides, by use of the
doubly-lengthened syllable, by varying the extent of
his cola, and by the irrationality of the penultimate foot,
has, within the limits of the same metre, produced a
sense of exotic beauty and urgency, a thrill of wildness
as well as of awe.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) <i>Dochmiacs.</i>—It is convenient to discuss these
here, though the dochmius is not a foot, but a colon.
The rule both of metre and music is that all feet or bars
should have the same time-value; a trochaic colon may
contain ⏗ or  ᷋⏑ as well as –⏑, but not –⏑⏑. Dochmiacs
are generally regarded as an exception to this rule.
The dochmius is a colon of which the simplest form<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> is
⏑– –⏑–, to be divided ⏑⁝– –⏑|–ꞈ||, <i>e.g.</i> κακορρημόνων.
The dochmius is always catalectic, but the anacrusis of one
serves to complete the trochee of the preceding colon:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">φανήτω μόρων ὁ κάλλιστ’ ἐμῶν</div>

<p class="noindent">This metre is frequent in passages of lamentation, and
as these are extremely numerous the dochmiac measure

most difficult, because of the many varieties admitted.

several of these are rare; this great number is due to

<p class="noindent">The second line of course would by itself have no rhythm
at all, being so completely broken to pieces, in order to
express the extreme limit of agitation possible in articulate
speech. But it gains rhythm from the clearer lines
of the context. The antistrophe shows a further variety—an
irrational syllable in the last line:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">ὑπομένεις με τὸν τυφλὸν κηδεύων.</div>

<p class="noindent">(κηδευ͐ων). Evidently it is important to accustom one’s
ear thoroughly to the basic form ⏑– –⏑– and to ⏑⏑⏑–⏑–.

<p>The last division of our subject is the different types
of period, the various ways in which cola are combined

in which the cola are of the same length. The scheme</p>

(παλινῳδία, “repetition”), in which not a single colon
but a group of cola is repeated so far as length is concerned:—</p>

<p>Most of the periodic structures which have been described
are by no means obvious to the ear. A trained
sense of rhythm, attention to quantity, and careful practice,
will reduce the difficulties. But in any case Greek
periods are far less easy to grasp than English. Their
variety and length, the frequent occurrence of prolongation,
resolution, and irrational syllables, the possibility
of preludes or postludes—all these are formidable to
modern students, who lack the help of the music. We
may perhaps work out the period with ease on paper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
but our ear often cannot appreciate the balance and contour
of the whole as it can in English lyrics, where we
have the immense assistance of a rhyme-scheme. But
it is no sound deduction that the study of Greek lyric
metre and rhythm is therefore useless. We cannot
always hear the period—that is a question of music;
but we can always hear the colon—that is a question of
language. To utter the cola correctly is easy after a
little practice; and it is these “sentences” which, by
their own internal rhythmical nature and by the identities
or contrasts existing between them, reinforce and more
pungently articulate the sense of the words wherefrom
they are moulded.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> These first paragraphs give a summary of the view almost universally
held as to the origin of Greek tragedy. Of late, however, Professor Sir
William Ridgeway (<i>The Origin of Tragedy, with Special Reference to the
Greek Tragedians</i>, Cambridge, 1910) has combated current beliefs with
great vigour. His belief is (p. 186) “that Tragedy arose in the worship of
the dead, and that the only Dionysiac element in the Drama was the satyric
play”. Aristotle’s evidence (see p. 4) he dismisses as mistaken, because
“Aristotle was only interested in Tragedy as a fully developed art, and
paid little heed to its early history” (p. 57). The present writer is bound
to confess that, after following and estimating to the best of his ability the
numerous and heterogeneous statements put forward in evidence, he cannot
regard Professor Ridgeway’s contention as proved. It is undoubtedly true
that many extant tragedies centre more or less vitally upon a tomb, but
many do not. The mimetic ritual in honour of the slain Scephrus
(p. 37) is real evidence, so far as it goes; but the utmost it proves is that
Greek tragedy <i>could</i> have arisen from such funeral performances—it does
not show that it did. The most remarkable point in the book is the discussion
of the well-known passage in Herodotus (V, 67): τά τε δὴ ἄλλα οἱ
Σικυώνιοι ἐτίμων τὸν Ἄδρηστον καὶ δὴ πρὸς τὰ πάθεα αὐτοῦ τραγικοῖσι χοροῖσι
ἐγέραιρον, τὸν μὴν Διόνυσον οὐ τιμέωντες, τὸν δὲ Ἄδρηστον. Κλεισθένης δὲ
χοροὺς μὲν τῷ Διονύσῳ ἀπέδωκε, τὴν δὲ ἄλλην θυσίην Μελανίππῳ (see
Ridgeway, p. 28): “The men of Sicyon paid honours to Adrastus, and in
particular they revered him with tragic choruses because of his sufferings,
herein honouring not Dionysus, but Adrastus. Cleisthenes gave the
choruses to Dionysus, and the rest of the offering to Melanippus.” It
may well be that Professor Ridgeway is right in asserting that ἀπέδωκε
means not “restored” but “gave”—that is, these tragic choruses were
originally of the funereal kind which he suggests for all primitive Greek
tragedy. This is excellent evidence for his contention, so far as it goes,
but it only proves one example. Herodotus’ words, on the other hand,
imply that he believed tragedy to be normally Dionysiac. To sum up,
we cannot regard Professor Ridgeway as having succeeded in damaging
the traditional view.</p>

to believe that Aristotle never mentions the “Three Unities”. On the
Unity of Action he has, of course, much to say; the Unity of Time is dismissed
in one casual sentence. As to the Unity of Place there is not a
word. (It is signally violated in the <i>Eumenides</i> and the <i>Ajax</i>.)</p>

due to “long runs”. After saying the same thing hundreds of times, an
actor naturally tends to mechanical diction. The writer has heard a performer
in an emotional crisis suddenly (as it appeared) call for champagne.
Feeling sure that “Pommery” could not be right, he reflected,
and discovered that the mysterious syllables meant “Poor Mary!” Even
actors at the head of the profession are guilty of such things as “the lor
of Venice”.</p>

even the defendant was acquitted. This rule was explained as derived
from the “Vote of Athena” in the trial of Orestes. It seems then that
Athena’s vote here makes inequality, not equality. Therefore her pebble
is not put into either urn, but laid between them.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_251" href="#FNanchor_251" class="label">[251]</a> Dr. Verrall (<i>Introduction</i> to his edition, pp. xxxii, xxxiii) explains the
reconciliation of the Furies as the result of a mystic revelation conveyed
not in words but through a kind of spiritual magnetism exercised by
Athena when she draws near to them at v. 886 (he notes the break in
syntax at this point); such an influence could not be shown forth in words—it
is too sacred and mysterious. But if a poet does undertake to dramatize
the truths of religion, he must do so in dramatic form; he ought not suddenly
to throw up his task. Several places in Æschylus can be found
where he does put such ideas into words.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_252" href="#FNanchor_252" class="label">[252]</a> This appears to me certain from Athena’s language to the court,

these lines with brilliant aptness. “The language is so simple, so

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_412" href="#FNanchor_412" class="label">[412]</a> It is almost certain that only two actors were employed, Alcestis
being mute in the last scene (<i>i.e.</i> the character was apparently borne
by a supernumerary, not the actor who had delivered her earlier
speeches), and the few lines of the child Eumelos being sung by a
chorister. Croiset suggests: protagonist, Apollo, Alcestis, Heracles,
Pheres; deuteragonist, Thanatos, maidservant, Admetus, attendant.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_413" href="#FNanchor_413" class="label">[413]</a> The true explanation, as Dr. Hayley points out, is that the two
actors are already engaged (as A. and H.) so that the queen is presented
by a mute. I cannot, however, agree that this is “a clumsy device”.
Admetus deserved some modification of his delight; we may, moreover,
feel that Alcestis would not wish to show precipitation in greeting the
husband who had interred her with such strange promptitude.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_421" href="#FNanchor_421" class="label">[421]</a> The hurried obsequies probably do not fall into this category. We
are almost certainly to assume that as Alcestis’ sacrifice is to be made
on a certain day, that day must see her not only expire, but actually
delivered up to the power of death. See Dr. H. W. Hayley’s <i>Introduction</i>
to the play (pp. xxxi <i>sq.</i>) and my <i>Riddle of the Bacchæ</i>, pp. 143 <i>sq.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_422" href="#FNanchor_422" class="label">[422]</a> I cannot write with decision about the <i>Alcestis</i>, because on the
one hand universal testimony and opinion date it as only seven years
anterior to the <i>Medea</i>, while my own instinct would put it quite twenty
years earlier than that play. To me it reads essentially like the work
of a young but highly-gifted playwright who has recently lost his wife.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_423" href="#FNanchor_423" class="label">[423]</a> These celebrated lines (vv. 230-51) are not in character. They

<p><a id="Footnote_424" href="#FNanchor_424" class="label">[424]</a> (i) In vv. 1231-5, there is a very clear dittography. That is, either
1231-2, or 1233-5 would serve excellently as a speech of the chorus-leader;
but it is unlikely that the poet meant both to be used; (ii) vv. 1236-50
read like another and far shorter version of the great soliloquy 1021-80;
(iii) it seems odd that Medea, after finally gaining courage to slay her
children, should before doing so, be seen again and join in conversations;
(iv) vv. 1375-7 give the impression (as Dr. Verrall has pointed out) that the
play is to end, not as it does, but with some kind of arrangement between
Medea and Jason; (v) one or two ancient quotations purporting to come
from this play are not to be found in our texts.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_512" href="#FNanchor_512" class="label">[512]</a> Its popularity in Byzantine times is no bar to this statement. Probably
all the three plays, <i>Hecuba</i>, <i>Phœnissæ</i>, and <i>Orestes</i>, were chosen
because the Greek was comparatively easy. Euripides was already sufficiently
ancient to make this an important consideration.</p>

<p>Miss L. E. Matthaei’s essay should, however, be read (<i>Studies in
Greek Tragedy</i>, pp. 118-57). With admirable insight and skill this
scholar seeks to show that the <i>Hecuba</i> is a study, first, of “conventional”
justice, the claim of the community, shown in the sacrifice of Polyxena;
and, secondly, of “natural” justice, seen in Hecuba’s revenge. Miss
Matthaei’s treatment, however subjective, is trenchant and illuminating,
especially as regards the psychology of Hecuba and Odysseus, the value
of Polyxena’s surrender, and the <i>finale</i>. But concerning the vital point,
lack of dramatic unity, she has little to say, apparently only the suggestion
(p. 140) that “the cumulative effect of finding the body of Polydorus
after having seen Polyxena taken away is the deciding factor; otherwise
the end of the play would have been simply unbelievable”. The strength
of this argument is very doubtful.</p>

alleged synchronous action. But how much time is required? Orestes
is to place Hermione in Menelaus’ care, journey to Delphi, and arrange
his plot; then the slaves are to carry the body home. This certainly
means three days; one would expect a week. Thus Peleus only hears
of Hermione’s departure three days (perhaps a week) after it has occurred.
Is this credible? See also the conversation between him and the chorus
which implies that the news has reached him within an hour or two.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_689" href="#FNanchor_689" class="label">[689]</a> Verrall (<i>Eur. the Rationalist</i>, pp. 231-60) believed that those parts
which introduce Antigone are un-Euripidean. The terrace-scene has already
been discussed. In the body of the play, as he argues with much
point, wherever mention of Antigone occurs, it is obtrusive and embarrassing.
Her lament with Œdipus at the close contains many inappropriate
features. He concludes that Œdipus is an allegory of Euripides himself,
leaving Athens in sorrow at the end of his life, and that Antigone represents
his literary offspring, the plays. The Sphinx is “the spirit of
mystery and darkness,” which the poet has fought and quelled. All this
was composed by a poet of the Euripidean circle to commemorate the
master; it includes a compliment—the quotation from the <i>Œdipus Tyrannus</i>—to
Sophocles, who had shown public respect to his rival when the
news of his death reached Athens.</p>

some beautiful and striking observations on the epiphany of Apollo and its
effect on the raving mortals below: a trance falls upon them from which
they awake purged of hate and anger. But could Euripides, can we,
attribute this to a god who has commanded matricide? And the effect is
largely spoiled by Orestes (vv. 1666 <i>sqq.</i>): “Prophetic Loxias, what oracles
are thine! Thou art not, then, a lying prophet, but a true. Yet had I
begun to dread lest, when I heard thy voice as I thought, it was that of a

the present writer’s <i>Riddle of the Bacchæ</i>. This theory has met with
much scepticism, but received the honour of almost entire acceptance by
the late Dr. Verrall in <i>The Bacchantes of Euripides</i>. Dr. Verrall improved
the statement of the theory, in particular by rejecting the supposition
of a plot between Tiresias and the Stranger. Mr. W. H. Salter, in
his delightful <i>Essays on Two Moderns</i>, also accepts this view of the play
in the main (pp. 50-68). Dr. R. Nihard, in <i>Le Problème des Bacchantes
d’Euripide</i> (Louvain, 1912), a useful study, rejects it.</p>

possibly be said is what Professor Gilbert Murray (<i>Euripides and his Age</i>,
pp. 186 <i>sq.</i>) and (in a letter to the present writer) Professor U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff
suggest, that the palace is in the main destroyed, but the
façade is more or less undamaged. This does away with the testimony
to Dionysus’ imposture which the audience receive from their own eyes,
but it leaves untouched the incredible silence of Pentheus. Moreover,
Dionysus’ words as they stand mean that the building is utterly destroyed.
That they do not mean this is only suggested in despair, because, if they
do mean this, they are absurdly and patently false.</p>

a vowel at the end before a vowel in the following line. See, for instance,

<p><a id="Footnote_864" href="#FNanchor_864" class="label">[864]</a> It is so called because the second half of the fifth foot <i>plus</i> the sixth
will obviously have the metrical form –⏑–, which sequence of syllables,
when it forms a single foot (as, of course, it does not in iambics), is called
a cretic. The rule is therefore often thus stated: “When the final cretic
extends over a whole word or whole words, it must be preceded by a short
syllable”.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_865" href="#FNanchor_865" class="label">[865]</a> Iambics were adopted because nearer to the rhythm of everyday
speech. It has been held, for instance by Dr. J. H. H. Schmidt, that
iambics are nothing but trochaics with “anacrusis” (for this term see
below, p. 342). So near is the iambic metre to ordinary talk that one now
and again finds accidental “lines” in prose. Thus Demosthenes (<i>Olynth.</i>,
I, 5) writes δῆλον γάρ ἐστι τοῖς Ὀλυνθίοις ὅτι.... George Eliot, early in
<i>Middlemarch</i>, actually produces two consecutive “lines”: “Obliged to
get my coals by stratagem, and pray to heaven for my salad-oil”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_866" href="#FNanchor_866" class="label">[866]</a> Euripides is much fonder of this metre than the other two masters.
Sophocles in particular is very sparing of it. That passage (<i>Philoctetes</i>,
1222 <i>sqq.</i>), where Odysseus and Neoptolemus hurry upon the scene in
violent (iambic) altercation, would infallibly have been put into trochaics
by Euripides.</p>

repeats from beginning to end the same period, each period being usually
two cola “which either have equal length, or the second of which is
catalectic or ‘falling’ or is even shortened by an entire measure” (see
Schmidt’s <i>Introduction</i>, Eng. tr. by Prof. J. W. White, pp. 93 <i>sqq.</i>).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_882" href="#FNanchor_882" class="label">[882]</a> Though my obligations to Dr. J. H. H. Schmidt’s volumes, especially
<i>Die Eurhythmie in den Chorgesängen der Griechen</i>, are very great,
I cannot see in his verse-pause—according to him (<i>Eurhythmie</i>, p. 89) the
foundation of his system—anything but a delusion. Dr. Schmidt’s own
appendices show a good minority of “verses” which end with no pause.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_883" href="#FNanchor_883" class="label">[883]</a> The first two syllables (⏑⏑) correspond to the first (–) of Οἰδίπου.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_884" href="#FNanchor_884" class="label">[884]</a> How? By examination of the whole period. If we look at the
seventh line of the strophe from <i>Antigone</i>, scanned above, it may seem
arbitrary to write</p>

<div class="pre-container">

</div>

<p class="noindent">rather than</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
    ⏗  –
| αιν|ανꞈ‖.
</pre>
</div>

<p>But the former method
is suggested by the corresponding fourth line, which cannot possibly be
scanned otherwise than as above, and which therefore has four feet; hence
we scan -αιναν so as to give the seventh line also four, not five, feet
altogether.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_885" href="#FNanchor_885" class="label">[885]</a> It is therefore possible to scan the ordinary iambics of dialogue as
trochees:—</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<pre>
˃     – ⏑    –  ˃      –  ⏑ –  ˃   –    ⏑  –
ειθ ⁝ ωφελ | Αργους | μη δι|απτασθ|αι σκαφ|οςꞈ (<i>Medea</i>, 1).
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is the method followed by Dr. J. H. H. Schmidt, and of course
changes altogether the rules given above (§ II), but will hardly perplex the
student. It has the advantage of bringing “iambic” dialogue closer to
lyric and to episodic trochees, but it has seemed more convenient to keep
the traditional statement.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_887" href="#FNanchor_887" class="label">[887]</a> Because spondaic <i>words</i> are lacking. It is sometimes said that the
only spondee in English is “amen”. The peculiar pronunciation of this
word is due to the fact that it is so often sung to music where each syllable
is given a whole bar. The name of Seaford in Sussex is undoubtedly pronounced
by its inhabitants ∸∸; but one may perhaps therefore argue that
it should be written “Sea Ford”.</p>
